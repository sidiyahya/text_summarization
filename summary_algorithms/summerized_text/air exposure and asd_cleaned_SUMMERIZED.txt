SUMMARY SPACY 



The Funnel plots in Fig E1  overall shows little bias
of publication Fig E2 demonstrates each study’s relative contri
bution to the metaestimates for each air pollutant We found 1 to 3
studies contributed at least 20 of each pollutant two out of 9
studies  for PM25 three out of 9 studies


studies  for NO2 and one out of 4
studies  for ozone This implies the metaestimates
are overall sensitive to a few speciﬁc studies
While all studies contained casecontrol designs except 2
studies Pagalan et al  and Guxens et al  Guxens et al
used a cohort study for the prenatal period only  for PM25
PM10 and NO2 reporting the ORs for EU and 4 individual countries
We approached this study for our metaanalysis in two ways 
excluding it to include casecontrol studies only and  including it
as four individual studies meaning a total of 12 studies for PM25 12
studies for PM10 and 10 studies for NO2 Overall the metaestimates
were comparable with little difference in signiﬁcance regardless of
the Guxens study 
To focus on maternal exposure our metaanalysis excluded two
studies in Table 1 because they reported the ORs for a postnatal
period only  or a combined period with prenatal
period  but included 5 studies that reported pre
conception or postnatal periods along with prenatal period
