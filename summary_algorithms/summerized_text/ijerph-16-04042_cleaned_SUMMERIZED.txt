SUMMARY SPACY 



An environmental risk index based on the use of antibiotics during
pregnancy andor the breastfeeding period was associated
Greater numbers of oral antibiotic ﬁlls during the ﬁrst 3 years of
enrollment were found to signiﬁcantly increase the hazard rate of
having a later GIrelated diagnosis in both children with and
Children with autism showed higher oral antibiotic usage in
The use of various antibiotics showed an increased risk of

32 MetaAnalysis Result Relating the ASD Risk in Antibiotic Exposure
To investigate the association between ASD and antibiotic exposure the ASD risk was analyzed
based on the antibiotic exposure and control group As shown in indicated that early antibiotic exposure including pre and postnatal signiﬁcantly increased the
ASD risk in children  with moderate heterogeneity
 As shown in exposure signiﬁcantly increased the ASD risk  with
moderate heterogeneity  Furthermore as shown in exposure signiﬁcantly increased the ASD risk in children OR  1159 95 CI 1040–1293 p  0008

results in seven of the included studies however in subgroup analyses the results of the Egger’ tests

In our study both pre and postnatal
antibiotic use increased the ASD risk use was signiﬁcantly elevated in children with ASD compared to controls to compare or discuss the risk levels of prenatal and postnatal antibiotic use because studies on the
relationship between ASD risk and postnatal antibiotic use did not specify the prenatal antibiotic
exposure  Further studies on the relationship between ASD onset and prenatal antibiotic use
did not speciﬁcally mention a followup on postnatal antibiotic exposure  However the results
of our bidirectional metaanalysis suggest that prenatal antibiotic exposure is a more potent risk
factor for ASD This is further indicated by a prebirth cohort study that examined the association
between pre and postnatal smoking exposure and atopic eczema and reported that only prenatal
smoking exposure increased the risk of atopic eczema by 711 times compared to postnatal smoking
exposure  Moreover ASD which is an early complex neurodevelopmental disorder is known
to develop before the age of three  In particular the fetal period is a crucial period in brain
development and exposure to harmful environmental factors during this period can substantially
increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders  One study reported that prenatal opiate
exposure aﬀected brain development  Therefore prenatal antibiotic exposure is believed to be an
important risk factor for ASD onset  Indeed early postnatal antibiotic exposure is known to
increase ASD risk However in our study the reduced inﬂuence of postnatal antibiotic exposure on
increasing ASD risk could be attributed to the age range of our study population 
Further studies comparing pre and postnatal antibiotic use with adjustment for various confounders
should be conducted to conﬁrm our results

Although we systematically analyzed the relationship between ASD and early antibiotic exposure
this study has a few limitations First although we analyzed various data on antibiotic exposure
including the number and amount of exposure as well as diverse antibiotic mechanisms we could not
analyze according to antibiotic type due to insuﬃcient data Further we did not consider the gestational
age in prenatal exposure and used a wide age range for postnatal exposure Second although we
used a randomeﬀects model to address the high heterogeneity and indicated no publication bias
except for the total results relating to ASD in early exposure we had a limited sample size Third
postnatal antibiotic exposure remains controversial Although the test results on publication bias
showed low statistical signiﬁcance they cannot be considered conclusive on their own given the small
sample size and their closeness to statistical signiﬁcance There has been ambiguity in distinguishing
diﬀerent periods in previous studies on the eﬀects of pre and postnatal antibiotic use Further small
experimental and large investigative studies reported contradicting ﬁndings due to the diﬃculty of
adjusting for various confounders which were described as limitations Thus there is a need for large
controlled experimental or cohort studies adjusting for potential confounders to clearly determine the
impact of postnatal antibiotic exposure on ASD
5 Conclusions
Notwithstanding these limitations this study remains signiﬁcant since it used twosided
metaanalyses to systematically analyze the relationship between ASD and early antibiotic exposure
and provides more evidence on the association between ASD risk and prenatal antibiotic exposure
