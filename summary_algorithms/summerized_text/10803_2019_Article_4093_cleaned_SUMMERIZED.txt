SUMMARY SPACY 



Hypothetically these observed 
effects could be attributable to microbiota alterations trig
gering a disturbed immune response and the release of 
cytokines thus affecting the function of the central nerv
ous system  Recently a number of 
observational studies have assessed a possible association of 
earlylife antibiotic exposure and subsequent development 
of ASD Here we aimed to systematically document avail
able evidence on the association between early life antibiotic 
exposure and the prevalence of ASD later in in childhood
Methods
InclusionExclusion Criteria for the Review
Cohort studies case–control studies and crosssectional 
studies  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  this  review  The 
included  studies  needed  to  investigate  an  association 
between pre andor postnatal antibiotic exposure and sub
sequent diagnosis of ASD We included studies in which 
women during any trimester of pregnancy or infants and
or children underwent antibiotic treatment We focused on 
earlylife antibiotic exposure that preceded a diagnosis of 
ASD which is usually established after the second year of 
life  Studies on antibiotic exposure in 
breastfeeding mothers and subsequent risk of ASD in their 
children were not included Since the hypothesized link 
between ASD and antibiotic use is based on the aforemen
tioned microbiomegutbrain axis mechanism only stud
ies which reported data on systemic andor oral antibiotic 
therapy were taken into an account Any antibiotic types 
and doses as well as any treatment durations and indica
tions were admissible as long as the therapy fulfilled the 
aforementioned criteria Studies that reported data on anti
biotic use collectively  
or that did not report numerical data were excluded Studies 
in which the data on antibiotic use was collected only for the 
purpose of baseline characteristic of participants with no 
analysis of the association between antibiotic use and ASD 
were also excluded

The studies involved respec
tively 96736 children including 976 with ASD Atladot
tir et al 2012 and 780547 children including 9352 with 
autism  Population of the first study 
was most likely contained within the population of the sec
ond therefore we didn’t perform a metaanalysis The first 
study reported a borderline significant increase in the risk 
of ASD after use of any antibiotics anytime during preg
nancy adjusted hazard ratio  12 95 confidence 
interval  10–14 A stronger association of prenatal 
antibiotic exposure with the risk of ASD was reported for 
the use of sulfonamides anytime during pregnancy aHR 
15 95 CI 10–22 and use of penicillins during the sec
ond  and third  
trimester Similar results were observed for infantile autism 
 with 
the strongest association reported for the use of macrolides 
anytime during the pregnancy  
Confounding factors controlled for in adjusted model were 
as follows gender maternal age parity maternal smoking 
during pregnancy paternal age parental psychiatric history 
and parents’ educational status
The second study reported a significant positive asso
ciation between exposure to any antibiotic anytime during 
pregnancy and subsequent risk of autism in the offspring 
 The analysis was adjusted 
only for sex and age Assessment of this association was not 
a primary focus of the study and it was only reported as a 
secondary analysis in the supplementary materials
Case–Control Studies
Four of the included case–control studies examined risk of 
ASD after prenatal antibiotic exposure Among them two 
clinicbased studies  
were available for a metaanalysis They were conducted in 
groups of children of 343  and 314 136 
with ASD respectively None of those studies found sig
nificant associations between antibiotic use and ASD with 
pooled odds ratio from random effect model of 124 95 
CI 053–292 tors used for the analysis
However a significant association was no longer observed 
in the betweenwithin sibling model aHR 105 95 CI 
093–118 and aHR 105 95 CI 095–116 for penicillin 
and broaderspectrum antibiotics respectively In another 
study performed in 780547 children including 9352 with 
autism  the risk of autism increased 
after broadspectrum antibiotic exposure before the age of 
5  Moreover risk of autism 
was higher after exposure to broadspectrum and moder
atespectrum antibiotics anytime during childhood aHR 
151 95 CI 133–172 and aHR 122 95 CI 113–132 
respectively Both of these studies controlled for a range 
of potential confounders including different demographic 
pregnancy and neonatal factors parental psychiatric history 
and parity
Since at least two studies of the same type reported the 
aHR of ASD after antibiotic exposure a metaanalysis was 
feasible However the two Danish studies were performed in 
highly overlapping populations so pooling of their data was 
not justifiable To perform a metaanalysis we used the data 
from the 1 of the 2 Danish studies in which the exposure 
and its timing were consistent with those in the Canadian 
study  Pooling of the data did not yield 
any significant association between antibiotic exposure and 
subsequent diagnosis of ASD either in the standard model 
 or in 
the sibling model summary effect estimate 105 95 CI 
096–114 both in random effects  and fixed 
effects analysis
Case–Control Studies
Three case–control studies examined association between 
ASD and childhood antibiotic exposure One internet sur
veybased study performed in 1515 children 1001 with 
ASD  which reported the data in 
the form of logistic regression OR found a positive associa
tion between the number of antibiotic courses taken during 
the first 2 years of life and subsequent diagnosis of ASD in 
all performed analyses including the final multifactor model 
 The study controlled for 
age of the child ethnicity maternal education and region
Another study performed in a group of 214 children 73 
with autism  reported crude ORs of 
autism in children exposed postnatally to antibiotics com
pared to unexposed unrelated controls OR 243 95 CI 
09–652 and unexposed healthy siblings OR 203 95 
CI 040–91 Additionally a multivariable modeling of data 
was performed with use of the AutoCM artificial neural net
work—a method that does not generate numerical results but 
rather provides a map of associations of strength between all 
variables in the data set According to the authors’ interpre
