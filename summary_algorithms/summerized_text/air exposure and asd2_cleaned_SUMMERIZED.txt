incremental risk When available  we computed three models for each metaanalysis a global model using all risks listed in included articles a pessimistic
model using only the less favorable data and an optimistic model using only the most favorable 95CI 95 conﬁdence intervals Each metaanalysis is represented in the forest
plot by a dot on a horizontal line with the corresponding number of articles  included within the metaanalysis The white dots represent the odds ratio 
and the length of each line around the dots represent its 95 conﬁdence interval  An overall summary pooledestimate  is
represented by a blue lozenge at the end of the graph The black solid vertical line represents the null estimate  Horizontal lines that cross the null vertical
line  represent nonsigniﬁcant studies
the optimistic model only an increased risk during pregnancy with
both the global and optimistic models and an increased risk
regardless of the model used during the postnatal period
37 Metaregressions and sensitivity analyses
Using categorical levels of exposure PM25 tended to lead to
greater increased risk of having a child with ASD compared with
exposure to PM10 
NOx  and solvents
 No other differences
between air pollutants exposure were noted nor between peri
conceptional periods or trimesters Neither parental age or gender
of newborns were found to inﬂuence the risk of ASD insufﬁcient data other sociodemographic variables were not
We demonstrated that global air pollution exposure in the
perinatal period is a risk factor for ASD in newborns Supplementary
is the ﬁrst to report a risk based on consideration of all air pollut
ants As exposures are in general multiple when quantifying risk it
is likely that overall risk is of most interest as reported by other
authors  ASD
was ﬁrst described as a disorder in children with problems relating
to others highly sensitive to changes in their environment Kanner
1968 Prevalence of ASD appears to have increases over time
 possibly due to
a modiﬁed deﬁnition of ASD enhanced awareness and improved
diagnosis  but
also to a global increase in air pollutants in most megalopolis
 The rigorous
and sensitive statistical approach used in this metaanalysis

available  we computed three models for each metaanalysis a global model using all risks listed in included articles a pessimistic model using only the less
favorable data and an optimistic model using only the most favorable 95CI 95 conﬁdence intervals Each metaanalysis is represented in the forestplot by a dot on a horizontal
line with the corresponding number of articles  included within the metaanalysis The white dots represent the odds ratio  and the length of each line
around the dots represent its 95 conﬁdence interval  An overall summary pooledestimate  is represented by a blue lozenge at
the end of the graph The black solid vertical line represents the null estimate  Horizontal lines that cross the null vertical line  represent non
signiﬁcant studies
allowed analysis of several included studies presenting different
data for the same risk eg several models adjusted on different
covariables There are presently no guidelines on how to manage
this issue  To avoid potential limitations we
created three models for each metaanalysis a global model based
on all risks reported in included articles a pessimistic model using
less favorable risks only  and an optimistic
model using the most favorable risks only Unsurprisingly use of
optimistic models led to stronger results but notably we were
unable to demonstrate an increased risk using the pessimistic
model based on all air pollutants
42 PM25 a public health issue
Risk of developing ASD in newborns increased using the global
and optimistic models only for all air pollutants with a strong high
risk following exposure to PM25 whatever the model Even use of
the pessimistic model based on the least favorable data those with
the least increased risk revealed a minimum increased risk of 6
 Nearly all individual studies
showed that maternal exposure to PM25 was associated with
increased risk of newborns with ASD Becerra
