SUMMARY SPACY 




treatment of confounders on the basis of study design or data analysis 2 
points and  the quality and completeness of exposure assessment 3 
points  For  cohort studies the  three  sections correspond  to   the 
assessment  of  possible  bias  in  the  selection  of  both  exposed  and 
25 Analytical approach 
Effect modifiers evaluated based on the literature review included 
 child’s sex  markers for socioeconomic status maternal educa
tion race and neighborhood deprivation and other characteristics from 
census data  maternal factors nutrition maternal immune activa
tors such as diabetes and  genetics We summarized the results of 
effect modification from each study 
Additive or multiplicative interaction effects between the modifier 
and air pollution exposure were reported if available For studies that 
showed only results from stratified analyses by susceptibility factors 
evaluation  of  effect  modification  was  based  on  comparison  of  each 
subgroup’s effect size as described by Altman and Bland  We 
calculated  the  original  coefficients  and  standard errors  from  the  re
ported odd ratios or hazard ratios and corresponding 95 confidence 
intervals reported in most studies The difference between the original 
regression coefficients was assessed with the Wald test using the pooled 
standard error from the two strata An example is presented in Supple
mentary Table S4 
3 Results 
31 Study selection 
Studies identified and then excluded at each step of selection are 
shown in the PRISMA flow chart  were identified through 
the database search of which 296 were duplicates The remaining 976 
articles were screened by title and abstract and 937 publications that 
were  not  empirical  human  studies  on  the  association  between  air 
pollution and ASD were excluded A total of 39 articles studied the as
sociation between ambient air pollution and ASD were identified In the 
fulltext assessment another 20 studies were excluded because they did 
not examine any effect modifiers  A total of 
19 publications were included in this review 
Table 1
Based on method described by Altman and Bland  An example of calculation is shown in Table S4 

 
Three studies  demonstrated 
no consistent pattern of effect modification of the air pollutionASD 
association by education level  Becerra et al  found 
that the effect of trafficrelated NO2 during pregnancy on ASD was sta
tistically significantly higher in children whose mothers did not grad
uate from high school than in children whose mothers graduated high 
school However in the same study stronger associations of CO and NO2 
exposure during pregnancy were observed in children with maternal 
education level greater than high school compared with those with less 
than high school and these differences in point estimates were statis
tically  significant  A  Swedish  study  reported  that  associations  of 
trafficrelated NOx and PM10 exposure during pregnancy and the first 
year of life were stronger in the more educated subgroup with more 
than 12 years of education but neither main effects nor interactions 
were statistically significant  An ecological study on 
air  toxics  found  that  the  association  of  mercury  with  ASD  risk  was 
significantly higher in census tracts with belowaverage percentage of 
college educated households   
• Neighborhood characteristics 
Two casecontrol studies examined the modifying effect of neigh
borhood deprivation based on an index including income education 
unemployment and other socioeconomic characteristics in small socio
economically homogeneous areas  One US study found that 
children living in the most deprived neighborhoods had stronger ASD 
associations with PM25  during the first year 
of  life   
 When modeling PM25 as a continuous variable 
the interaction between neighborhood deprivation level also was not 
significant in the same study  
In contrast a Swedish study 
found that trafficrelated NOx and PM10 exposure during the first year of 
life were more strongly associated with ASD in less deprived neighbor
hoods   Kalkbrenner et al 
 reported that there were no modifying effects of census tract 
urbanicity  on the association of 
air toxics with ASD Dickerson et al  found that children from 
census tracts with higher poverty rates had stronger associations of a 
combined metals index with ASD  
• Race 
Racial differences in effects were examined in only one ecological 
study in which there was an association of ASD with unhealthy air 
quality  only among Asians which was not significant OR

founders  
342 Maternal factors 
Two studies reported effect modification by maternal factors one for 
folic acid intake and one for maternal diabetes In a casecontrol study 
Goodrich et al  found that children of mothers with low folic acid 
intake during the first trimester  had 
stronger associations of ASD with NO2 than mothers with sufficient folic 
acid intake  
 Jo et al  reported increased ASD risk associated with 
first trimester O3  exposure among mothers with gestational diabetes 
mellitus  diagnosed 24 weeks’ gestation adjusted HR 150 per 
157 ppb O3  compared to mothers without dia
betes No O3 associations with ASD were observed among children of 
mothers with later onset GDM or with preexisting diabetes 
343 Genetic factors 
Two  studies  of  interactions  with  genetic  factors  were  identified 
 Kim et al  examined 15 interactions between 3 types of 
copy number variation  burden  
and  5  air  pollutants  NO2  O3  PM25  and  PM10  and  nearroadway 
pollution Only interactions of O3  exposures during pregnancy per 
62 ppb with CNV duplication burden per increase of 1356513 base 
pairs OR  155  and with total CNV burden OR 
136  were significant In another study ASD risk 
was increased in association with an interaction of exposure to high 
PM10 NO2 and dispersionmodeled nearroadway pollution dichoto
mized at the 75th percentile of each distribution with the MET receptor 
tyrosine kinase rs CC genotype compared to MET CG or GG 
genotype  
4 Discussion 
Since Windham et al  published the first study of the associ
ation between prenatal air toxics and the risk of ASD in 2006 more than 
30 papers have examined air pollutionASD association in diverse pop
ulations and regions
