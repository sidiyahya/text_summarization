SUMMARY SPACY 



The present study used a comprehensive search strategy and explored the relationship between maternal smoking 
during pregnancy and ASD in offspring Three previously published metaanalyses have shown no significant 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring analyzing 5 or 15 individual studies29–31 Our main 
analysis which included 22 studies and is the first to include an observational study in an Asian population also 
showed no significant association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and ASD mine the source of the substantial heterogeneity in our main analysis we performed subgroup analyses using 
metaregression with various modalities We produced novel findings by comparing results by study location 
and by using populationlevel measures of tobacco consumption In subgroup analyses a significant positive 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in the offspring was observed in studies conducted in China 
and Europe but not those in North America Correlating with these relative rankings the smoking population 
of adult males in China and the European countries represented in this analysis except Sweden are higher than 
the adult male smoking populations in the US and Canada  Our metaregression analysis with adult 
male smoking prevalence in each country as a continuous moderator also indicated a significant correlation with 
ASD risk smoke exposure reported by youth and adult women sure may indeed increase ASD risk in offspring but that exclusively assessing active maternal smoking under
estimates total exposure which includes secondhand smoke before or after birth Measures of smoking in the 
overall population may provide this missing measure of secondhand smoke exposure thereby modulating the 
relationship between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring to produce significant correlations
Two important limitations of using the smoking prevalence data should be noted First the 2008 smoking 
prevalence data were used for all subjects included in the metaanalysis who were born between 1980–2012 
The 2008 report was chosen because it was the earliest report to comprehensively and systematically measure 
smoking prevalence in member countries
The passive smoke exposure in these studies was not 
exclusive to paternal smoking and included for example exposure from smoking colleagues active maternal 
smoking data was not reported Together these results suggest that paternal smoking may be an important factor 
for its impact on maternal smoke exposure during pregnancy rather than for direct effects on the father’s role in

Importantly populationlevel smoking is one of many possible risk factors for ASD Results of our subgroup 
and moderator analyses indicated that populationlevel tobacco consumption study location and study sample 
size could only account for 14 of the total heterogeneity found in this analysis As noted in the introduction 
there are several adverse outcomes such as low birth weight linked to both maternal smoking and to ASD 
that not only suggest maternal smoking is a plausible environmental cause of ASD but also pose potential con
founds for studying the direct association between ASD and maternal smoking Several observational studies 
included in our metaanalysis adjusted for potential confounding factors either by matching controls to cases on 
One significant result from our subgroup analyses was that maternal smoking was associated with elevated 
ASD risk in studies with the lowest quartile of sample sizes   Interestingly 
all six studies in the lowest quartile of sample sizes assessed maternal smoking exposure after birth subgroup 
analyses showed that this method of maternal smoking assessment used in 922 studies was also associated with 
an increased risk of ASD   Additionally all 422 studies that diagnosed 
ASD by direct evaluation are represented in the lowest quartile of samples sizes The significance of this obser
vation is unclear it may be that studies directly evaluating ASD had small sample sizes necessitated by limited 
resources and that the significant effect of sample size in our subgroup analysis is due to sampling bias
In summary our study included 22 observational studies and is the first to include one conducted in an Asian 
population While our main metaanalysis is consistent with previous metaanalyses in finding no significant 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring our subgroup and moderator analyses with pop
ulation smoking metrics suggest that a more nuanced interpretation of this null association is warranted In 
future studies more consistent and systematic examination of nonmaternal sources of in utero or developmental 
nicotine exposure such as smoking in the fathers household or general population may yield important results
Methods
Data Sources and Searches  We followed PRIMSAP guidelines for metaanalytic studies Literature 
searches were conducted on PubMed EMBASE Web of Science and Cochrane Library to identify peerreviewed 
Study Selection  Full texts of potentially relevant reports were examined for the following inclusion criteria 
 a cohort or casecontrol design and  data reported in such a way that the authors could extract or calculate 
the number of ASD cases with mothers who did and did not smoke during pregnancy and control subjects with 
mothers who did and did not smoke during pregnancy Two authors  independently confirmed fulfill
ment of inclusion criteria
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment 
Information was extracted from each study as a contingency 
table using a binary maternal smoking variable and a binary ASD variable Any maternal smoke exposure during 
pregnancy was considered positive for maternal smoking and any ASD in offspring regardless of subtype was 
considered positive for ASD Two authors  independently extracted data and resolved any disagree
ments by discussion Additionally the following data were extracted last name of the first author publication
