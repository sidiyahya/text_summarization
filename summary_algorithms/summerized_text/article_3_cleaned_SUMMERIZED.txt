SUMMARY SPACY 



Based
on the NewcastleOttawa scale ratings 7 studies 
were excluded Thus 10 studies  were included
in the metaanalyses including 8 cohorts and 2 case
control studies NewcastleOttawa Scale results for the
cohort studies are described on Supplemental Table 1
while descriptions of
studies are
reviewed on Supplemental Table 2 Characteristics of
the included studies are presented on Supplemental
Table 3
ART vs natural conception  
Risk of cerebral palsy
Prevalence of cerebral palsy was reported in 5 studies
 ART was associated with higher risk
of cerebral palsy RR 182  z  461 p 
000001 I2  19 p  029 risk of 7 per 1000 births at ART group and 4 per 1000
births at baseline population  No
risk of publication bias  and no small
study bias  were
acknowledged 
the casecontrol
Risk of intellectual disability
Risk of intellectual disability new terminology for men
tal retardation in DSM5 and ICD11  was reported
in 5 studies  Risk of intellectual dis
ability in children born after ART treatments was not
different from the risk in children from natural concep
tions RR 101  z
The high number of children at risk
reported prevalence of cerebral palsy in children from ART it can be concluded that children born from ART have a higher risk of acquiring
cerebral palsy compared to children from nonART  On the other hand the risk of acquiring intellectual disability  autism
spectrum disorder  and behavioral problems  in children from ART is similar with children from natural conceptions
risk of cerebral palsy in both groups is similar while risk of intellectual disability  and autism spectrum disorder  in children from ICSI are
significantly higher than children from conventional IVF
was due to one study of casecontrol with 12 ratio of
children with CP and normal children  Risk of pub
lication bias  and smallstudy bias
 were undetected

Risk of intellectual disability
Prevalence of intellectual disability was reported in 3 studies
 Risk of intellectual disability in children born
after frozen embryo transfer is not significantly different
compared to children from fresh embryo transfer RR 088
 z  078 p  044 I2  0 p  091 with absolute risk at 4 per 1000 births in frozen embryo
transfer group and 5 per 1000 births in fresh embryo transfer
group  Risk of publication bias
 and smallstudy bias Habordâ€™s
As previous reports have suggested the risk of ac
quiring DNA fragmentations during cryopreservation
and thawing processes might be associated with re
duced numbers and proportion of trophectoderm cells
 higher prevalence of neurodevelopmental disor
ders in children from frozen embryo transfer is ex
pected To our
results
showed that there are no significant differences be
tween the risks of neurodevelopmental disorders in
children from frozen embryo transfer compared to
the risk in children from fresh embryo transfer Previ
ous studies also reported that frozen embryo transfer
resulted in increased live birth rate and higher neo
natal birth body weight  The improvement of
cryopreservation techniques such as vitrification and
elective frozen embryo transfer might result in better
pregnancy and neonatal outcome 
Limitations
The present study has several limitations First the num
ber of studies that reported neurodevelopmental out
comes from different ART procedures is limited This
limitation correlates with the limited number of patients
and the possibilities that some of the findings might be
population specific Secondly singleton and multiple
births could not be differentiated in some studies Previ
ous studies suggested that multiple pregnancy carries
higher risks of prematurity and low birth body weight
 both could potentially contribute to the risks of
neurodevelopmental disorders
the
matched casecontrol studies could introduce potential
conclusion bias on the absolute number of children at
risk in the normal population To overcome all of these
limitations future studies that involve larger populations
with sufficient background information are required
Conclusion
In conclusion children from ART have a higher risk of
acquiring cerebral palsy than children from natural con
ceptions This increased risk is possibly associated with
confounding factors
including preterm birth and low
body birth weight Based on this finding it is reasonable
to perform deliveries of children from ART at facilities
with available neonatal intensive care unit  thus
treatment of potential cerebral insults after birth can be
optimized Furthermore children from ICSI carry higher
risks of
intellectual disability and ASD than children
from conventional IVF These findings suggest the im
portance of
longterm followup and preimplantation
genetic screening particularly in fertilizations by ICSI
Lastly cryopreservation and thawing of embryos did not
seem to cause increases in any risks of neurodevelop
mental disorders therefore freezeall strategy seemed
plausible
