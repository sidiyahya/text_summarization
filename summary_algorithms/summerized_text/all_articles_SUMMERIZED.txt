SUMMARY SPACY 



In contrast a Swedish study 
found that trafficrelated NOx and PM10 exposure during the first year of 
life were more strongly associated with ASD in less deprived neighbor
hoods   Kalkbrenner et al 
 reported that there were no modifying effects of census tract 
urbanicity  on the association of 
air toxics with ASD Dickerson et al  found that children from 
census tracts with higher poverty rates had stronger associations of a 
combined metals index with ASD  
• Race 
Racial differences in effects were examined in only one ecological 
study in which there was an association of ASD with unhealthy air 
quality  only among Asians which was not significant OR

founders  
342 Maternal factors 
Two studies reported effect modification by maternal factors one for 
folic acid intake and one for maternal diabetes In a casecontrol study 
Goodrich et al  found that children of mothers with low folic acid 
intake during the first trimester  had 
stronger associations of ASD with NO2 than mothers with sufficient folic 
acid intake  
 Jo et al  reported increased ASD risk associated with 
first trimester O3  exposure among mothers with gestational diabetes 
mellitus  diagnosed 24 weeks’ gestation adjusted HR 150 per 
157 ppb O3  compared to mothers without dia
betes No O3 associations with ASD were observed among children of 
mothers with later onset GDM or with preexisting diabetes 
343 Genetic factors 
Two  studies  of  interactions  with  genetic  factors  were  identified 
 Kim et al  examined 15 interactions between 3 types of 
copy number variation  burden  
and  5  air  pollutants  NO2  O3  PM25  and  PM10  and  nearroadway 
pollution Only interactions of O3  exposures during pregnancy per 
62 ppb with CNV duplication burden per increase of 1356513 base 
pairs OR  155  and with total CNV burden OR 
136  were significant In another study ASD risk 
was increased in association with an interaction of exposure to high 
PM10 NO2 and dispersionmodeled nearroadway pollution dichoto
mized at the 75th percentile of each distribution with the MET receptor 
tyrosine kinase rs CC genotype compared to MET CG or GG 
genotype  
4 Discussion 
Since Windham et al  published the first study of the associ
ation between prenatal air toxics and the risk of ASD in 2006 more than 
30 papers have examined air pollutionASD association in diverse pop
ulations and regions
In our study both pre and postnatal
antibiotic use increased the ASD risk use was signiﬁcantly elevated in children with ASD compared to controls to compare or discuss the risk levels of prenatal and postnatal antibiotic use because studies on the
relationship between ASD risk and postnatal antibiotic use did not specify the prenatal antibiotic
exposure  Further studies on the relationship between ASD onset and prenatal antibiotic use
did not speciﬁcally mention a followup on postnatal antibiotic exposure  However the results
of our bidirectional metaanalysis suggest that prenatal antibiotic exposure is a more potent risk
factor for ASD This is further indicated by a prebirth cohort study that examined the association
between pre and postnatal smoking exposure and atopic eczema and reported that only prenatal
smoking exposure increased the risk of atopic eczema by 711 times compared to postnatal smoking
exposure  Moreover ASD which is an early complex neurodevelopmental disorder is known
to develop before the age of three  In particular the fetal period is a crucial period in brain
development and exposure to harmful environmental factors during this period can substantially
increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders  One study reported that prenatal opiate
exposure aﬀected brain development  Therefore prenatal antibiotic exposure is believed to be an
important risk factor for ASD onset  Indeed early postnatal antibiotic exposure is known to
increase ASD risk However in our study the reduced inﬂuence of postnatal antibiotic exposure on
increasing ASD risk could be attributed to the age range of our study population 
Further studies comparing pre and postnatal antibiotic use with adjustment for various confounders
should be conducted to conﬁrm our results
