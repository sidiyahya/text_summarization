et al 1996 Air pollution is composed of a wide range of pollutants
such as particulate matter  nitrogen oxide  volatile
organic compounds pesticides ozone  and metals Lam et al
2016 Kalkbrenner et al 2018 Though few studies have focused
on pregnancy and risk of ASD air pollutants such as PM PM10
with an aerodynamic diameter  10 mm appear to have the
highest levels of toxicity Oberd€orster et al 2005 de Kok et al
2006 Among PM10  PM25 which have
an even smaller aerodynamic diameter 25 mm are particularly
harmful penetrating more rapidly easily and deeply into the or
ganism  Despite a
recent article  no metaanalysis to date has
provided an overview or comparison of the effects of classes of air
pollutants  or the effects of sociodemographic
risk factors such as parental ages gender of newborns or smoking

In addition there are no published guidelines as yet on how to
manage different data relating to a same risk within an included
article 
 and no metaanalysis presented both risks
quantiﬁed either as continuous  or
as categorical variables 
We hypothesized that there was an increased risk of developing
ASD associated with air pollution during pregnancy This meta
analysis focused on the association between children with ASD
and exposure to air pollutants during the perinatal period from
preconception to the second year of life and involved three models
for each metaanalysis by air pollutant a global model using all
risks listed in included articles a pessimistic model using less
favorable data only and an optimistic model using the most
favorable data only We also investigated related sociodemographic
inﬂuences
2 Methods
21 Literature search
We reviewed all studies reporting an association between air
pollutants and ASD The PubMed Cochrane Library ScienceDirect
and Embase databases were searched for all original articles pub
lished up to July 2020 using the keywords “air pollution” and
“autism” or synonyms see Appendix 1 for detailed search strat
egy
Inclusion criteria included articles written in English or
French and that described our primary outcome variable ie the
association between perinatal exposure to ambient air pollution
and risk of ASD The perinatal period included the preconception
period to the second year of life Studies were required to report
risk estimates in the form of odds ratios  with 95 conﬁdence
interval  or to provide data that allowed OR calculation In
order to identify studies not found through our database search
strategy a manually search of new articles was carried out using
reference lists from all publications meeting inclusion criteria and
systematic reviews Our search strategy is presented in Appendix 1 Two authors  separately conducted all
literature searches collated and reviewed the abstracts based on
selection criteria and decided on the suitability of articles for in
clusion When questions arose over article suitability a third author
 reviewed the articles Having reached a consensus all
included articles were reviewed by the three authors
22 Quality of assessment
The methodological quality of the studies was further evaluated
using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network  model
for case control and cohort studies 
The following 15 items were assessed appropriate and clearly
focused question selection bias  performance bias 1
item attrition bias  detection bias  confusion
bias  presence of conﬁdence intervals and general level of
evidence  model  with the following 9
items selection bias  comparability bias  and
outcome bias   “No”  “Can’t say”  or “Not
applicable”  with the exception of item 21 to minimize risk of
bias or confounding and the ﬁnal item concerning evidence level
of the SIGN checklist which was assigned “0” “þ“ or “þþ“ Any
disagreements over suitability were discussed with a third author
 and a consensus reached Assessment of article quality was
carried out for the two checklists by two authors

d’Azy et al 201632 33 Characteristics of
pollutant exposure of individuals or other variables were reported
for each study as mean ± standarddeviation  and number 
for continuous and categorical variables respectively 
When data could be pooled we conducted random effects meta

pollutants exposure centered at one Particular attention was paid
to the type of statistics retrieved from the included articles OR or
other risk measurements Air pollutants exposure were quantiﬁed
either as a continuous  or as cat
egorical variables  For the highest level
of proof we ﬁrst normalized all OR for a standardized increment in
pollutant concentration for example per 5 mgm increase in
al 2013b using the
PM25 We took into account the original
increment of the
pollutant and we assumed a linear exposure outcome relationship

parts per billion  we transformed those levels in mgm for
example NO2 1 ppb ¼ 188 mgm O3 1 ppb ¼ 2 mgm Jarvis

percentile differences were converted into effects per concentra

each metaanalysis three models were used a global model of all
risks listed in the included articles a pessimistic model using less
favorable data only and an optimistic model using the most
favorable data only Finally we computed the aforementioned
metaanalyses categorical using OR based on categorical exposure
 For air pollutants that were the most
reported we also computed sensitivity analyses depending on the
methods to measure air pollutants Heterogeneity between studies
was evaluated through forest plots and their conﬁdence intervalsEnvironmental Pollution 278  116856

 and Isquared  e varying from 0 to 100 Heterogeneity is
considered low for I225 modest for 25I250 and high for
I250 For example a signiﬁcant heterogeneity may be due to the
variability between the characteristics of the studies such as the
exposure to air pollutants  periconceptional
periods

trimester  characteristics of individuals age of
mothers and fathers smoking gender of newborns etc To ensure
the robustness of our results we conducted sensitivity analysis by
searching for potential publication bias through funnel plots
 of aforementioned metaanalyses Then we reper
formed metaanalyses without the studies that were not evenly
distributed around the funnel base  When sample
size allowed metaregressions were performed to investigate the
relationship between risk of ASD in newborns following air
pollutant exposure and putative variables such as type of air
pollutant periconceptional period pregnancy trimester and pop
ulation characteristics Results were expressed as regression co
efﬁcients and 95 CI

37 Metaregressions and sensitivity analyses
Using categorical levels of exposure PM25 tended to lead to
greater increased risk of having a child with ASD compared with
exposure to PM10 
NOx  and solvents
 No other differences
between air pollutants exposure were noted nor between peri
conceptional periods or trimesters Neither parental age or gender
of newborns were found to inﬂuence the risk of ASD insufﬁcient data other sociodemographic variables were not
analyzed Results were similar using continuous levels of exposure
For PM25 and PM10 metaanalysis depending on the methods to
measure air pollutants showed similar results
4 Discussion
The main ﬁndings revealed that air pollution particularly that of
PM25 during the periconception period was associated with an
increased risk of ASD in newborns in all models used The level ofevidence is poor for other air pollutants Exposure during preg
nancy  and postnatal periods may be the
most atrisk periods The increased risk of ASD following exposure
to air pollutants surrounding pregnancy was not linked with soci
odemographic factors
41 Air pollution and risk of ASD in newborns
We demonstrated that global air pollution exposure in the
perinatal period is a risk factor for ASD in newborns Supplementary
is the ﬁrst to report a risk based on consideration of all air pollut
ants As exposures are in general multiple when quantifying risk it
is likely that overall risk is of most interest as reported by other
authors  ASD
was ﬁrst described as a disorder in children with problems relating
to others highly sensitive to changes in their environment Kanner
1968 Prevalence of ASD appears to have increases over time
 possibly due to
a modiﬁed deﬁnition of ASD enhanced awareness and improved
diagnosis  but
also to a global increase in air pollutants in most megalopolis
 The rigorous
and sensitive statistical approach used in this metaanalysis

available  we computed three models for each metaanalysis a global model using all risks listed in included articles a pessimistic model using only the less
favorable data and an optimistic model using only the most favorable 95CI 95 conﬁdence intervals Each metaanalysis is represented in the forestplot by a dot on a horizontal
line with the corresponding number of articles  included within the metaanalysis The white dots represent the odds ratio  and the length of each line

the end of the graph The black solid vertical line represents the null estimate  Horizontal lines that cross the null vertical line  represent non
signiﬁcant studies
allowed analysis of several included studies presenting different
data for the same risk eg several models adjusted on different
covariables There are presently no guidelines on how to manage
this issue  To avoid potential limitations we
created three models for each metaanalysis a global model based
on all risks reported in included articles a pessimistic model using
less favorable risks only  and an optimistic
model using the most favorable risks only Unsurprisingly use of
optimistic models led to stronger results but notably we were
unable to demonstrate an increased risk using the pessimistic
model based on all air pollutants
42 PM25 a public health issue
Risk of developing ASD in newborns increased using the global
and optimistic models only for all air pollutants with a strong high
risk following exposure to PM25 whatever the model Even use of
the pessimistic model based on the least favorable data those with
the least increased risk revealed a minimum increased risk of 6
 Nearly all individual studies
showed that maternal exposure to PM25 was associated with
increased risk of newborns with ASD Becerra et al 2013 Kaufman
et al 2019 Raz et al 2015 Ritz et al 2018 Talbott et al 2015a
Volk et al 2013 Chen et al 2018 Jo et al 2019 McGuinn et al
2020 Goodrich et al 2018 Kim et al 2017 Thus indicating the
high level of evidence concerning the deleterious effects of PM25
and related risk of ASD PM25 particles appear to be the most
dangerous pollutant due to their small size and high volatility Yan
et al 2020 able to be transported over longer distances Yan et al
2020 They also have a lower sedimentation velocity than other
larger particles such as PM10 69 PM are primarily composed of
toxic particles such as PAHs inorganic particles sulfate nitrate
ammonium or organic carbon metals Kim
et al 2015 Naimabadi et al 2016 As road trafﬁc is one of the
primary sources of PM emission de Kok et al 2006 Kim et al
2015 Cui et al 2016 and predicted to double over the next
twenty years  the impact of PM25 on
health may become a major public health issue 
As diesel is considered to emit more ﬁne PM than gazoline Cui
et al 2016 Assessmentf 2002 it may become a target for future
preventive strategy Levels of evidence are poor for the other air
pollutants investigated
43 Late pregnancy and early postnatal period a key
developmental periods
Late pregnancy and early postnatal periods were found to be the
most atrisk periods for developing ASD following air pollution
exposure These periods are crucial in the development of the in
fant  and can inﬂuence longterm health
outcomes  Late pregnancy is impor
tant for placental function fetal growth and brain developments
and is also the period when maternal and fetal complications can
occur such as gestational diabetes preeclampsia hypoxia or brain
injury Dugan and MaCrawford 2019 Ellery et al 2018
Schumacher et al 2020 Ridder et al 2019 Our result showing
increased risk of ASD during late pregnancy is in accordance with
previous metaanalyses  Similarly the early
postnatal period can also impact health outcomes as has been
shown with breastfeeding which may impact a wide range of pa
rameters such as cognition brain structure structural development
of the heart and lungs bone health or atopy SantiagoCruz et al
2019 Lucas 2019 In comparison with the metaanalysis of Chun
et al we highlighted the detrimental effects of air pollution leading
to increased risk of ASD during the postnatal period being previ
ously analyzed in relation to the prenatal period Our results show
that the most atrisk periods for ASD were early and late pregnancy
and the early postnatal period These results are in accordance with
other studies on air pollution that have showed these periods to
also be the most atrisk for other birth outcomes such as hyper
tension preeclampsia preterm birth or low birthweight Zhang

because of collinearity The effect of each variable on the outcome is represented in the
forestplot by a dot on a horizontal line The white dots represent the coefﬁcient for
each variable and the length of each line around the dots represent their 95 conﬁ
dence interval  The black solid vertical line represents the null estimate with a

and the early postnatal period appear key phases as regards
vulnerability to air pollution 
44
Inﬂuence of sociodemographic and other factors
Most often etiologies of ASD remain unknown Although ge
netic susceptibility has been highlighted as a risk factor Lee et al
2020 No included studies in our metaanalysis indicated genetic
susceptibility Two further highlighted risk factors concern parental
age and the newborn gender Several studies have shown that
maternal andor paternal age Veldkamp et al 2020 Gao et al
2020 and male gender Cogley et al 2020 Ruigrok and Lai
2020 were associated with an increased risk of
child
lines that cross the null vertical
neurodevelopmental outcomes such as ASD In our metaanalysis
neither parental age or newborn genders were found to inﬂuence
risk following exposure to air pollutants However our meta
regressions analyzed whether air pollution modiﬁes this risk
depending on parental age or newborn genders Other investigated
putative risk factors for ASD include maternal food intake Zhong
et al 2020 low birthweight or preterm birth Cogley et al
2020 Talmi et al 2020 As these factors were not assessed in
the articles included in our metaanalysis further analyses were
precluded
45 Limitations
Our study has some limitations Despite the large number of
studies some air pollutants were only included in a few studies
Common air pollutants such as PM25 PM10 or NOx were how
ever commonly assessed and as we included a large sample of 395
615 newborns this allowed the greater generalizability of our re
sults Our metaanalysis inherited the limitations of the 28 included
studies and was therefore subject to individual bias such as bias of
measures of exposure to air pollutants and bias of reporting of ASD
Despite the quality of research reﬂected in the studies included in
our metaanalyses ASD covers a wide range of severity that was not
reported within included articles Diagnostic method for ASD also
differed limiting quality of data and precluding further analyses
although most articles used National ASD databases thus guaran
teeing data accuracy A further limitation concerns a possible un
derestimation of our results Diagnostic evidence of ASD can be
underestimated but is unlikely to be overestimated Similarly
methods for detection or measurement of air pollutant exposure
differed between studies thus precluding assessment of dose
response effects In addition despite similarities population char
acteristics between studies were not identical Data were collected
in various countries but excluded developing countries The ma
jority of studies were conducted in the USA Kalkbrenner et al
2018 Becerra et al 2013 Dickerson et al 2016 Dickerson et al
2015 Kalkbrenner et al 2010 Kalkbrenner et al 2015 Kaufman
et al 2019 Raz et al 2015 Roberts et al 2013 Talbott et al
2015a Talbott et al 2015b Volk et al 2011 Volk et al 2014
Volk et al 2013 Jo et al 2019 McGuinn et al 2020 Goodrich
et al 2018 Windham et al 2013 Kim et al 2017 and to a
lesser extent in Europe Gong et al 2014 Gong et al 2017 Guxens
et al 2016 Ritz et al 2018 Oudin et al 2019 The lack of data
from Africa Asia and Oceania reduces potential generalizability of
our results though All ethnicities were included Generalizability
of our results may also be lessened due to analysis of singlesite
studies even if the majority of included studies were multisite
As studies differed in their study design we performed sensitivity
analyses allowing demonstration of similar results whatever the
design In our metaanalysis global model some included studies
appeared several times with different data for the same outcome
depending on adjustment models
In the absence of clear
consensus and despite having more effect sizes within each meta
analyses when compared with studies included in several highly
regarded published articles published Aldridge et al 2018
Fellmeth et al 2018 the weight of studies may have required
ponderation  This is one of the rea
sons for use of optimistic and pessimistic models when only one
data is available for each included article A further limitation of our
metaanalysis concerns included studies using OR adjusted on
different factors between studies even if adjusted OR may limit
confusion bias Finally causality may also be a limitation in retro
spective or casecontrol studies

5 Conclusion
Exposure to air pollution notably PM25 during pregnancy was
associated with an increased risk of ASD in newborns regardless of
the model used The level of evidence concerning other air pol
lutants is however poor Exposure during pregnancy and the
postnatal period appear to be the most atrisk periods
