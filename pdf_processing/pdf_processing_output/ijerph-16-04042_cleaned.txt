Although antibiotics are essential for treating some diseases antibiotic exposure has been
associated with various diseases Antibiotic use can cause abnormal changes in the human microbiome
Studies have suggested that when the altered microbiome is passed onto the fetus it increases the risk
of colitis and ASD by impeding neurological development  Further antibiotic exposure
has been reported to be weakly associated with the risk for ASD  however this association
cannot be clearly established given the diﬃculty of measuring fetal antibiotic exposure Studies have
also reported that postnatal antibiotic exposure is associated with ASD speciﬁcally postnatal use of
acetaminophen and antibiotics as well as ear infection were reported to increase the risk for ASD 
This indicates that despite continued studies on the association between ASD and antibiotics
a deﬁnitive conclusion is yet to be reached Particularly the lack of consensus on pre and postnatal
antibiotic exposure has hindered eﬀorts toward determining this relationship Therefore we aimed
to conduct twoside metaanalyses to clearly determine the relationship between ASD and antibiotic
use as well as present foundational data for preventive and management strategies for lowering the
ASD risk
2 Methods
21 Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
This metaanalysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines  and was
approved by the institutional review board of Gachon University 
We searched PubMed Embase Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases for all relevant
studies written in English and published before February 2019 The search terms used were antibiotic
OR antimicrob and autism OR ASD OR kanner syndrome OR PDD OR pervasive developmental
disorder For metaanalysis we included studies that reported the association between ASD and
pre or postnatal antibiotic exposure in childhood and excluded studies that did not report the
antibiotic exposure level as well as the ASD and control group We included observational studies
including casecontrol crosssectional and cohort studies and excluded commentary editorial and
review articles
22 Data Extraction and Analysis
All authors independently screened and selected relevant data and any disagreements were
resolved by discussion We extracted relevant data including ﬁrst author publication year study
design country sample size age of participants and related outcomes Moreover to assess the
association between ASD and pre or postnatal antibiotic exposure in childhood we extracted all
measurement data including prevalence data of patients with ASD and controls group as well as the
number and amount of pre and postnatal antibiotic exposure The risk estimates of ASD in antibiotic
exposure and the standardized mean diﬀerence  of antibiotic exposure in ASD were analyzed
via metaanalysis using the Comprehensive MetaAnalysis software version 3 Biostat Inc Englewood
NJ USA We assessed the heterogeneity using the Q statistic and I2 method while the randomeﬀects
model was applied in all analyses to address heterogeneity Subgroup analyses were performed
based on group diﬀerences in prenatal and postnatal exposure Publication bias was assessed using
funnel plots and Egger’s intercept p  005 indicated a signiﬁcant diﬀerence Furthermore for
quality assessment we used the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale  to assess the methodological quality
of the nine included studies  The NOS is a representative tool developed for metaanalysis
of nonrandomized comparative studies including casecontrol crosssectional and cohort studies
It comprises an adjustment item with the selection of study groups comparability of the groups and
determination of either the exposure or outcome of interest to evaluate the quality of articles included
in the metaanalyses
3 Results
31 Characteristics of the Studies
We initially identiﬁed 1877 studies Endnote reference database 1459 studies remained We excluded 1348 articles based on the titles and
60 articles based on the abstract and thus were left with 51 articles that were eligible for fulltext
screening After close review 42 publications were excluded because of lack of usable data and failure
to meet the inclusion criteria Finally a total of nine articles were identiﬁed and included in the
metaanalysis Table 1 shows the characteristics of the nine selected studies which were published
between 2007 and 2019 Moreover regarding study design there were 5 1 and 3 casecontrol
crosssectional and cohort studies respectively The subjects ranged from 27 to 949821 All studies
were performed in the USA Denmark Italy Lebanon Canada and Sweden The age of the subjects
ranged from birth to 18 years The outcomes of the nine studies were only described as related content
regarding ASD and antibiotic usage In addition the quality scores ranged from 5 to 8

Postnatal antibiotic use was associated with an increased ASD risk
Regarding potential risk factors the frequency of early antibiotic
use was higher in the autism group than in the typical group
In the multivariable analysis antibiotics were negatively
Children who received antibiotics had a reduced ASD risk
The rate of antibiotic use among children diagnosed with ASD was
more than 2fold that of the general population
An environmental risk index based on the use of antibiotics during
pregnancy andor the breastfeeding period was associated
Greater numbers of oral antibiotic ﬁlls during the ﬁrst 3 years of
enrollment were found to signiﬁcantly increase the hazard rate of
having a later GIrelated diagnosis in both children with and
Children with autism showed higher oral antibiotic usage in
The use of various antibiotics showed an increased risk of

4 Discussion
This study analyzed the relationship between ASD and early antibiotic use in children using
twosided metaanalyses Speciﬁcally we analyzed the relationship between ASD and pre and
postnatal antibiotic exposure in children using a systematic method Our results indicated that pre
and postnatal antibiotic use increased the ASD risk This is consistent with previous reports that pre
and postnatal antibiotic use causes ASD in children  In our study both pre and postnatal
antibiotic use increased the ASD risk use was signiﬁcantly elevated in children with ASD compared to controls to compare or discuss the risk levels of prenatal and postnatal antibiotic use because studies on the
relationship between ASD risk and postnatal antibiotic use did not specify the prenatal antibiotic
exposure  Further studies on the relationship between ASD onset and prenatal antibiotic use
did not speciﬁcally mention a followup on postnatal antibiotic exposure  However the results
of our bidirectional metaanalysis suggest that prenatal antibiotic exposure is a more potent risk
factor for ASD This is further indicated by a prebirth cohort study that examined the association
between pre and postnatal smoking exposure and atopic eczema and reported that only prenatal
smoking exposure increased the risk of atopic eczema by 711 times compared to postnatal smoking
exposure  Moreover ASD which is an early complex neurodevelopmental disorder is known
to develop before the age of three  In particular the fetal period is a crucial period in brain
development and exposure to harmful environmental factors during this period can substantially
increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders  One study reported that prenatal opiate
exposure aﬀected brain development  Therefore prenatal antibiotic exposure is believed to be an
important risk factor for ASD onset  Indeed early postnatal antibiotic exposure is known to
increase ASD risk However in our study the reduced inﬂuence of postnatal antibiotic exposure on
increasing ASD risk could be attributed to the age range of our study population 
Further studies comparing pre and postnatal antibiotic use with adjustment for various confounders
should be conducted to conﬁrm our results
Although we systematically analyzed the relationship between ASD and early antibiotic exposure
this study has a few limitations First although we analyzed various data on antibiotic exposure
including the number and amount of exposure as well as diverse antibiotic mechanisms we could not
analyze according to antibiotic type due to insuﬃcient data Further we did not consider the gestational
age in prenatal exposure and used a wide age range for postnatal exposure Second although we
used a randomeﬀects model to address the high heterogeneity and indicated no publication bias
except for the total results relating to ASD in early exposure we had a limited sample size Third
postnatal antibiotic exposure remains controversial Although the test results on publication bias
showed low statistical signiﬁcance they cannot be considered conclusive on their own given the small
sample size and their closeness to statistical signiﬁcance There has been ambiguity in distinguishing
diﬀerent periods in previous studies on the eﬀects of pre and postnatal antibiotic use Further small
experimental and large investigative studies reported contradicting ﬁndings due to the diﬃculty of
adjusting for various confounders which were described as limitations Thus there is a need for large
controlled experimental or cohort studies adjusting for potential confounders to clearly determine the
impact of postnatal antibiotic exposure on ASD
5 Conclusions
Notwithstanding these limitations this study remains signiﬁcant since it used twosided
metaanalyses to systematically analyze the relationship between ASD and early antibiotic exposure
and provides more evidence on the association between ASD risk and prenatal antibiotic exposure
Subsequent studies should further analyze the association of pre and postnatal antibiotic exposure
with ASD to contribute towards lowering the ASD risk and the prevention and management of ASD
in children
