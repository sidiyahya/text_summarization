and that women with lower SES have a higher tendency to smoke during pregnancy Additionally smoking is 
associated with adverse birth outcomes such as fetal growth restriction and low birth weight which are in turn 
associated with increased risk of ASD16 Smoking during pregnancy has also been associated with neurodevel
opmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder conduct disorder and antisocial behavior
Epidemiological studies exploring the relationship of maternal smoking during pregnancy and ASD have 
produced contradictory results For example in Swedish populations Lee et al found no evidence of an asso
ciation between maternal smoking and ASD risk while Larsson et al found a positive association OR  209 
95 CI 108–403 and Haglund et al found a negative association  Similarly 
positive 22 negative 24 and null25–28 associations have been observed in United States study populations Three 
metaanalyses have also been conducted each finding no evidence for a significant association between maternal 
smoking and ASD risk in offspring Gardener et al included 5 studies and reported an overall OR of 100 95 
CI 075–136 Rosen et al included 15 studies and found a summary OR of 102  while 
Tang et al analyzed a partially different set of 15 studies and found a summary OR of 102  
However these prior metaanalyses failed to account for studylevel and populationlevel factors regarding smoke 
exposure that may moderate the relationship between maternal smoking and ASD risk Specifically the studies 
do not systematically account for the possible role of indirect secondhand smoke exposure most of the observa
tional studies included in these metaanalyses only reported active maternal smoking This assessment alone may 
inadequately reflect total in utero nicotine exposure
Here we analyze population smoking prevalence in our metaregression to investigate how these measures as 
potential indicators of secondhand smoke exposure might moderate the relationship between maternal smoking 
and ASD Additionally two studies 32 supporting an association between maternal smoking and ASD risk have 
been published after the most recent metaanalysis One of the two studies is the first to report extractable data 
regarding maternal smoking and ASD in an Asian population Previous metaanalyses have only included studies 
conducted in European or North American populations Therefore the current metaanalysis also included a 
subgroup analysis by study location This study was conducted to assess the association between maternal smok
ing and ASD risk comprehensively and to examine study location and population smoking metrics as important 
studylevel and populationlevel moderators of this relationship
Results
Literature Search and Selection  Our search strategy returned a total of 2417 publications from 
PubMed EMBASE Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases  which automatically removed 638 duplicates An additional 129 duplicates 
were removed manually leaving 1650 articles that were screened by titles and abstracts for relevance to maternal 
smoking and ASD Studies included in previously published metaanalyses 31 were also evaluated for inclusion 
criteria After screening 26 studies remained for detailed evaluation of the full texts Four articles33–36 were then 
excluded for lacking sufficient data to fill the contingency table of binary maternal smoking and ASD variables 
Consequently 22 articles17–28 32 37–45 were included for metaanalysis
Study Characteristics  The 22 studies analyzed include seven cohort studies 23 39 40 43–45 and fifteen 
casecontrol studies 18 20–22 24–28 32 37 38 41 42 with a total of 795632 cases and 1829256 control participants 
Nine studies–20 37 38 41 42 45 were from Europe  
twelve studies21–28 39 40 43 44 were from North America  and one study was from Asia  
Information on smoking during pregnancy was collected during a prenatal visit or at birth in 1122 studies and 
ASD diagnosis was ascertained by medical records in 1622 studies 
Quality Assessment and Publication Bias  Two authors independently assigned NewcastleOttawa Scale 
 scores to each study with high correlation between scorers   081 p  000001 the studies had moderate methodological quality as scored on a conservativelyinterpreted NOS with an average 
score of 65 and a range of 4–9 Based on thirds of the range of scores four studies were considered “high” quality 
with NOS scores of 8 or 917 22 25 37 ten studies were considered “medium” quality with NOS scores of 6 or 718 21 
23 26 38–40 42 44 45 and eight studies were considered “low” quality with NOS scores of 4 to 5519 20 24 27 28 32 41 43  

The shape and symmetry of the funnel plot of the log ORs from the 22 studies are illustrated in rank correlation test  and Egger’s regression test  suggest no significant publication bias 47
Main Analysis  The pooled OR estimates showed that maternal smoking during pregnancy was not associ
ated with a significantly increased risk of ASDs    15694 p  00001
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses and Moderator Analysis with Metaregression  To identify 
potential causes of the high heterogeneity in our main analysis we performed subgroup and sensitivity analy
ses Subgroup analyses were stratified by study design location sample size quality adjustment for confound
ers maternal smoking assessment and ASD status ascertainment  
Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with significantly elevated risk of ASD in European popula
tions  and in the single study conducted in Asia  
but not in North American populations  Maternal smoking was also associ
ated with elevated ASD risk in studies with the lowest quartile of sample sizes  
Subgroup analyses by study design study quality and adjustment for confounders showed no significant dif
ferences in pooled ORs across strata Assessment of maternal smoking at a prenatal visit OR  110 95 CI 
103–117 or after birth  showed significant associations with ASD in offspring 
whereas assessment at birth  had an apparent protective effect  For the 
sensitivity analysis the pooled ORs varied moderately ranging from 108  when Gao et al 
was excluded to 117  when Bilder et al was excluded Case deletion diagnostics identified 
Talbott et al as a potential outlier The main metaanalysis without Talbott et al resulted in a similar pooled OR 
 as the original analysis 
Interestingly subgroup analysis using metaregression with a continuous moderator found that smoking 
prevalence in males in the country of each study had a significant influence on ASD risk after maternal smoking 
 The results also showed that the OR increased with increasing smoking prevalance percent
age Therefore we used the prediction function to obtain the average log OR values for the smoking prevalence 
percentages while holding the year constant Smoking prevalence in males by country showed a significant corre
lation with ASD risk   Correlations between population smoking metrics and measures of secondhand smoke expo
sure  Reports of secondhand smoke exposure in either youth or in female adults were only available for 
three  of the eight countries represented in our study precluding direct use of secondhand 
smoke measures in our metaanalyses Therefore we performed linear regression analyses to test the relationship 
between the population smoking metrics used in our analysis and the secondhand smoke exposure data we 
extracted from global survey reports These analyses showed significant positive correlations between smoking 
prevalence in adult males with youth reports of smoke exposure in the home   063 p  00001 and 
outside the home   061 p  0001   058 p  00001 and outside the home

Discussion
The present study used a comprehensive search strategy and explored the relationship between maternal smoking 
during pregnancy and ASD in offspring Three previously published metaanalyses have shown no significant 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring analyzing 5 or 15 individual studies29–31 Our main 
analysis which included 22 studies and is the first to include an observational study in an Asian population also 
showed no significant association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and ASD mine the source of the substantial heterogeneity in our main analysis we performed subgroup analyses using 
metaregression with various modalities We produced novel findings by comparing results by study location 
and by using populationlevel measures of tobacco consumption In subgroup analyses a significant positive 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in the offspring was observed in studies conducted in China 
and Europe but not those in North America Correlating with these relative rankings the smoking population 
of adult males in China and the European countries represented in this analysis except Sweden are higher than 
the adult male smoking populations in the US and Canada  Our metaregression analysis with adult 
male smoking prevalence in each country as a continuous moderator also indicated a significant correlation with 
ASD risk smoke exposure reported by youth and adult women sure may indeed increase ASD risk in offspring but that exclusively assessing active maternal smoking under
estimates total exposure which includes secondhand smoke before or after birth Measures of smoking in the 
overall population may provide this missing measure of secondhand smoke exposure thereby modulating the 
relationship between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring to produce significant correlations
Two important limitations of using the smoking prevalence data should be noted First the 2008 smoking 
prevalence data were used for all subjects included in the metaanalysis who were born between 1980–2012 
The 2008 report was chosen because it was the earliest report to comprehensively and systematically measure 
smoking prevalence in member countries However our metaanalytic approach and the wide range of birth 
Table 1  Summary of results from subgroup analyses aAveraged NOS scores of 8–9  6–7  and

years represented makes it impossible to precisely match population smoking indices to the subjects’ gestation 
Indeed we cannot exclude the possibility that male smoking may contribute to exposure after birth not dur
ing gestation Future studies could more accurately track this information by collecting information regarding 
secondhand smoke exposure directly from the mothers in observational studies Secondly the trend towards a 
negative correlation between OR of ASD risk and smoking prevalence in women although not statistically sig
nificant seems incongruent with the idea that this metric captures an important measure of secondhand smoke 
exposure However we found that female smoking prevalence compared to male smoking prevalence was less 
strongly correlated with secondhand smoke exposure by the extremely low smoking prevalence in females in China where only 37 of women reported current smok
ing compared to 215–306 of women in other countries Such low smoking rates in women have also been 
observed in other Asian countries such as South Korea where 71 of women smoked according to inperson 
selfreport surveys but 182 of women smoked according to urine cotinine content In comparison 478 
of men smoked according to selfreports and 551 of men smoked according to urine cotinine content There 
may be a similarly disproportionate degree of underreporting in Chinese women especially around pregnancy 
thereby skewing the data towards a negative trend
An alternate explanation is that the significant correlations between OR and male smoking prevalence indicate 
a primary effect of paternal smoking on ASD in offspring rather than through secondhand smoke exposure in 
the mother There is evidence that smoking induces significant changes of DNA methylation in sperm 53 DNA 
methylation is associated with changes in the gene expression profile In utero nicotine exposure in mice has been 
shown to induce such changes in gene expression through epigenetic modification Therefore it would not be 
surprising if both maternal and paternal smoking contribute to changes in gene expression underlying brain 
development However three studies included in our metaanalysis examined secondhand smoke exposure dur
ing pregnancy and their findings suggest that smoking increases ASD risk in offspring primarily through in utero 
exposure 32 41 Furthermore two other studies conducted in Chinese populations reported positive associations 
between passive maternal smoke exposure and ASD54 55 The passive smoke exposure in these studies was not 
exclusive to paternal smoking and included for example exposure from smoking colleagues active maternal 
smoking data was not reported Together these results suggest that paternal smoking may be an important factor 
for its impact on maternal smoke exposure during pregnancy rather than for direct effects on the father’s role in

the global tobacco epidemic  Male and  female smoking prevalence percentages compared to secondhand 
smoke exposure reported by female adults for exposures at home and at work according to the Global Adult 
Tobacco Survey accessed through CDC databases SHS  secondhand smoke
Importantly populationlevel smoking is one of many possible risk factors for ASD Results of our subgroup 
and moderator analyses indicated that populationlevel tobacco consumption study location and study sample 
size could only account for 14 of the total heterogeneity found in this analysis As noted in the introduction 
there are several adverse outcomes such as low birth weight linked to both maternal smoking and to ASD 
that not only suggest maternal smoking is a plausible environmental cause of ASD but also pose potential con
founds for studying the direct association between ASD and maternal smoking Several observational studies 
included in our metaanalysis adjusted for potential confounding factors either by matching controls to cases on 
One significant result from our subgroup analyses was that maternal smoking was associated with elevated 
ASD risk in studies with the lowest quartile of sample sizes   Interestingly 
all six studies in the lowest quartile of sample sizes assessed maternal smoking exposure after birth subgroup 
analyses showed that this method of maternal smoking assessment used in 922 studies was also associated with 
an increased risk of ASD   Additionally all 422 studies that diagnosed 
ASD by direct evaluation are represented in the lowest quartile of samples sizes The significance of this obser
vation is unclear it may be that studies directly evaluating ASD had small sample sizes necessitated by limited 
resources and that the significant effect of sample size in our subgroup analysis is due to sampling bias Overall 
there is still a large portion of heterogeneity in our analyses that is not accounted for
There are also general limitations to consider regarding ascertainment of exposure and case definition First 
half of the studies  relied on retrospective reporting which many believe may be more vulnerable to faulty 
recall and bias than prospective reporting especially if reported after an ASD diagnosis In both this and a pre
vious metaanalysis subgroup analyses showed that assessing maternal smoking at birth had an apparent pro
tective effect while assessment after birth produced the highest OR for ASD risk  Interestingly whereas 
Rosen et al found that prenatal assessment resulted in no significant relationship between maternal smoking and 
ASD our study found a small but significant effect in the prenatally assessed subgroup of studies OR  110 95 
CI 103–117 Empirically studies have shown that retrospective reporting is overall accurate and reliable 57  
One study found that retrospective recall of any smoking in pregnancy an average of 145 years later had 956 
and 803 sensitivity when compared to positive urine cotinine tests during pregnancy and prospective reporting 
at the first antenatal visit respectively and 932 and 929 specificity respectively when including only women 
who recalled any smoking after learning of pregnancy Importantly the study also found that there were no 
differences in child behavior problems specifically conduct disorder symptoms and antisocial behaviors between 
mothers’ whose retrospective recall of smoking status was or was not congruent with prospective reporting or 
cotinine levels Therefore the number of studies relying on retrospective reporting in our metaanalysis is likely 
not a significant issue and the results of the subgroup analyses in prenatally and postnatally assessed mothers 
may accurately reflect a positive association Second while retrospective timing of reporting may not be uniquely 
susceptible to bias selfreporting of maternal smoking may be particularly underreported if women are aware of 
its adverse health consequences andor perceive social disapproval
More importantly selfreporting of active smoking alone likely misrepresents total nicotine exposure In 
China 57 of women reported exposure to secondhand smoke In New York City 468  of preg
nant women who were nonsmokers were found to have serum cotinine levels indicating secondhand smoke 
exposure The results of our moderator analyses indicate a significant relationship between the risk of ASD in 
children whose mothers’ smoked during pregnancy and male population smoking prevalence which in turn was 
significantly correlated with reports of secondhand smoke exposure in youth and female adults Together these 
data may suggest that reports of active smoking alone neglects to account for nicotine exposure from secondhand 
smoking which when accounted for may provide new insight into relationships between maternal exposures and 
subsequent child outcomes
Another potential limitation is our broad definition of maternal smoking as any smoking during pregnancy 
which may have skewed our main analysis towards a null association if in utero nicotine exposure must meet 
some threshold to increase ASD risk Studies of attentiondeficithyperactivity disorder risk after exposure to 
maternal smoking in pregnancy suggest there may be such a dose effect if also true for ASD it would align with 
our interpretation that population smoking metrics capture secondhand smoke exposure which increases total 
in utero nicotine dose and therefore significantly predicts ASD risk In the observational studies included in our 
metaanalysis only Haglund et al reported smoking dosage
Limitations are also inherent in determining case or control status Our subgroup analyses showed no dif
ferences in ORs when ASD status was determined by direct evaluation or by medical or developmental records 
parental reporting of ASD status in the only two studies using this method resulted in a positive association 
  Diagnoses were variably based on DSMIII DSMIV DSMIVTR 
or DSMV criteria Our definition for positive ASD status was also broad and included all subtypes such as 
Asperger’s and Persistent Developmental Disorder if reported separately Additionally in one study we used 
a group with intellectual disability  but without an ASD diagnosis as the control group and ASD with or 
without ID as the case group It is unclear whether the various ASD subtypes have different etiologies either 
in general or specifically in relation to maternal smoking Future studies that more rigorously and consistently 
distinguish between subtypes may yield more information
In summary our study included 22 observational studies and is the first to include one conducted in an Asian 
population While our main metaanalysis is consistent with previous metaanalyses in finding no significant 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring our subgroup and moderator analyses with pop
ulation smoking metrics suggest that a more nuanced interpretation of this null association is warranted In 
future studies more consistent and systematic examination of nonmaternal sources of in utero or developmental 
nicotine exposure such as smoking in the fathers household or general population may yield important results
Methods
Data Sources and Searches  We followed PRIMSAP guidelines for metaanalytic studies Literature 
searches were conducted on PubMed EMBASE Web of Science and Cochrane Library to identify peerreviewed 
Study Selection  Full texts of potentially relevant reports were examined for the following inclusion criteria 
 a cohort or casecontrol design and  data reported in such a way that the authors could extract or calculate 
the number of ASD cases with mothers who did and did not smoke during pregnancy and control subjects with 
mothers who did and did not smoke during pregnancy Two authors  independently confirmed fulfill
ment of inclusion criteria
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment 
Information was extracted from each study as a contingency 
table using a binary maternal smoking variable and a binary ASD variable Any maternal smoke exposure during 
pregnancy was considered positive for maternal smoking and any ASD in offspring regardless of subtype was 
considered positive for ASD Two authors  independently extracted data and resolved any disagree
ments by discussion Additionally the following data were extracted last name of the first author publication 
year study design study location maternal smoking assessment method ASD status assessment method and 
unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios  with 95 confidence interval  or alternate statistic if reported 
and whether any adjustments for confounders were made in either participant selection or statistical analysis
Two authors  used the NewcastleOttawa Scale  to assess methodological quality A max
imum of nine points was assigned for eight items in three categories Selection Comparability and Exposure 
First each author independently determined preliminary NOS scores for each study which were discussed to 
arrive at a consensus definition of the eight items to be scored Subsequently the authors independently rescored 
each study according to the agreedupon criteria and averaged their scores
Data Analysis  Unadjusted ORs were calculated from the contingency tables abstracted from each study 
and combined to produce a measure of the association between maternal smoking and ASD risk Cochrane Q 
statistic  and the I2 statistic were used to assess the heterogeneity of studies 66 A 
randomeffects model was used to calculate the pooled OR in the context of a general linear model Smoking prev
alence in adult males or in adult females was used as a continuous moderator in the mixedeffects model to exam
ine to what extent these moderators influence the strength of the relationship between maternal smoking and 
autism A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess whether any individual study significantly affected pooled 
estimates by omitting one study in each turn using metaregression fitting Outliers or influencers in the stud
ies were diagnosed by examining studentized deleted residuals  difference of predicted average effect 
 and total changes in parameter estimate  in metaregression fitting Additionally 
subgroup analyses were performed to examine study design  location  
sample size  quality  adjustment for confounders  timing 
of maternal smoking assessment  and method of ascertaining ASD diagnosis 
 Begg’s rank correlation and Egger’s regres
sion tests were used to detect publication bias Metafor R package was used for all metaanalyses GraphPad 
Prism version 70 was used to calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient r to test for correlation between two 
authors’ independent NOS ratings and to test for correlations between population smoking metrics and measures 
of secondhand smoke exposure The correlation between female smoking prevalence and female adult smoke 
exposure based on GATS data was computed as a nonparametric Spearman correlation due to the nonGaussian 
distribution of data All statistical tests had a significance level of p ≤ 005 unless otherwise specified
Statistics  To determine the effect of moderators a mixedeffects model was used in which the unknown 
true effect yi is given by yi  β0  β1xi  …  βpxip  ui  ei where xip denotes the value of the pth moderator 
for the ith study and βp denotes the change in the average true effect for a one unit increase in xip The Metafor 
package is advantageous because it allows such mixedeffects models to be fitted with continuous or categorical 
x moderator variables compared to previous packages that only allow categorical moderator variables to be fit
ted Additionally ui  N where τ2 denotes the residual heterogeneity not accounted for by the moderators 
included in the model and ei  N where vi denotes sampling variances Some assumptions underlying the 
metaanalysis conducted by Metafor in general include  treating sampling variances as if they were known con
stants  treating τ2 as a constant after it has been estimated and  assuming effect sizes are normally distrib
uted Further explanation of this model can be found in the Metafor package manual and clinical vignette67
