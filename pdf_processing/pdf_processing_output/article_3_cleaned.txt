Conclusions Pooled estimates suggest that children born after ART are at higher risk of acquiring cerebral palsy
ICSI treatment causes higher risk of intellectual disability and ASD These findings suggest the importance of the
availability of intensive care unit at the time of delivery and longterm developmental evaluation particularly in
children from ICSI

Introduction
The dreams of many infertile couples to have offspring
have been made possible by assisted reproductive technol
ogy  Through its constant development morbidity
due to infertility has been massively decreased  Every
technique such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection 
and frozen embryo transfer is designed as solutions for
specific problems For example in cases where two previ
ous conventional in vitro fertilization  failed or if the
majority of sperms are immotile ICSI is the technique
that offers the highest possibility to acquire pregnancy
ies  Meanwhile when couples preferred to obtain
pregnancy at later stage cryopreservation enables
them to freeze embryos for implantation at later times 
Studies on prenatal and postnatal outcomes in ART
such as the risks of multiple pregnancies and congenital
malformations have
already been comprehensively
reviewed and metaanalyzed on previous publications
 Conversely
lesser number of studies have fo
cused on the neurodevelopmental aspects of children
from ART The nature of certain neurodevelopmental
disorders that might not be visible until later stage in
children’s
in obtaining longterm
followup and the fact that many disorders can only be
diagnosed and treated in a multidisciplinary fashion
might be some of the reasons that caused limitation in
the number of studies on neurodevelopmental outcomes
in these children Nonetheless several studies have been
published to date and it is important to gain consensual
conclusions on the actual risks of neurodevelopmental
disorders among these children
lives difficulties
This study aims to assess the risks of neurodevelop
mental abnormalities in children from ART treatments
in comparison to naturally conceived children through
metaanalysis As different ART treatments may trans
late into different pathophysiology the neurodevelop
mental outcomes
in children from different ART
techniques are also compared
Methods
Literature search and identification
This systematic review and metaanalysis was conducted
according
for
to the Preferred Reporting
Items
Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses  
reporting guidelines PubMed Scopus and Google
scholars’ databases were used to collect publications up
to January 16 2020 The following search terms were
applied reproductive techniques assisted OR assisted
reproductive OR in vitro fertilization OR in vitro
fertilization AND Child development OR adolescent de
velopment OR long term followup OR Developmental
disabilities OR Developmental disability OR Language
disorders OR Language disorder OR Neurodevelopment
OR mental disorder OR mental disorders OR neuro
psychiatry Additional studies were identified through
screening of the reference lists
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included if they  compared any neurode
velopment aspects in ART children to children from
natural conceptions and  described the neurodeve
lopment in children from common ART techniques in
cluding conventional IVF ICSI cryopreserved and fresh
embryo transfers then compared them to either children
in general population or children conceived by different
treatment modalities Studies were excluded if  infor
mation were insufficient particularly related to the sub
jects and parameters in the study  not including
original data such as reviews systematic reviews com
ments or editorial
including control
group  or could not ascertain the used
fertility treatment and  not written in English
Data collection and analysis
The title and abstract of every article were independently
reviewed by 3 authors  If the abstract
met the inclusion criteria the fulltext article was thor
oughly reviewed Reference lists on the identified publi
cations were screened for previously unidentified but
relevant studies The following information were re
trieved author country publication year number of pa
tients criteria of neurodevelopmental disorders and the
patients’ neurodevelopmental outcomes The quality of
methodology was assessed using the risk of bias criteria
that were specified in NewcastleOttawa Scale 
 not
letters
 Based on the final ratings highquality studies
 were included in the metaanalyses
Statistical analysis
Metaanalysis was performed using MantelHaenszel
risk ratio  with 95 confidence interval for dichot
omous data Metaanalysis was performed on subgroup
analysis based on the types of the acquired neurodeve
lopmental disorders including cerebral palsy intellectual
disability autism spectrum disorder and behavioral
problems To describe the overall risk of neurodevelop
mental disorders a metaanalysis of the overall data was
also conducted The RevMan version 53 software
 was used for these purposes
Inconsistency index  test which ranges from 0 to
100 was calculated to evaluate heterogeneity across
studies Values above 50 or p value  010 indicate a
significant heterogeneity Regressionbased Egger’s test
was used to evaluate small study effect and the risk of
publication bias p values less than 005 were considered
as significant bias Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment
tool  was used to assess the
risk of bias Certainty of the evidence quality was evalu
ated by using the Guideline Development Tool by
GRADEpro

Discussion
To our knowledge a metaanalysis on the neurodevelop
mental outcomes in children from ART has never been
performed This study aimed to make consensual con
clusions from all studies that investigated the neurodeve
lopmental outcomes in children from ART
including
ICSI conventional IVF
frozen embryo transfer and
fresh embryo transfer The results of this study are ex
pected to provide the reliable information for the pa
tients and healthcare workers to consider before starting
ART
As seen in ART treatments into account the results show that ART
children develop an increased risk of cerebral palsy but
not intellectual disability ASD or behavioral problems
Cerebral palsy is a permanent neurological disorder
characterized with disability to coordinate muscle tones
and movements This condition is caused by the damage
or dysgenesis of brain part that are involved in the co
ordination and movements of the body It has been con
sensually accepted that the common risk factors for
cerebral palsy are preterm birth and low birth body
weight  In our study we could confirm that
these are the most likely risk factors that were presented
among children from ART with cerebral palsy Supplemental sociated with higher preterm birth and low birth body
weight as they are also related to higher rates of
multiple birth ART procedures could cause monozy
gotic twinning related to zona pellucida manipulation
and extended in vitro culture Moreover double em
bryo transfers during IVF procedures
resulted in
higher chance of multiple pregnancy  Since the
pathogenesis of cerebral palsy could be initiated with
insults during gestation or after delivery we could
not conclude if
the pathogenesis of cerebral palsy
among ART children is due to the respiratory distress
that is caused by immature lungs which eventually
lead to cerebral hypoxia after birth or as a conse
quence of dysgenesis of part of the brain that is re
lated to movements and coordination Nonetheless
these findings revealed the importance of optimum
prenatal and neonatal care for ART children
in children from conventional
Interestingly when the neurodevelopmental out
comes in children from ICSI were compared to the
outcomes
in
creased risks of intellectual disability and ASD were
identified in the ICSI group It is widely known that
in some cases intellectual disability and cerebral palsy
are overlapping clinical conditions  However as
the differences in the prevalence of cerebral palsy in
children from ICSI and conventional IVF are statisti
cally insignificant we speculate that in these cases in
tellectual disability
to inert
factor
such as genetics Furthermore ASD has
been associated with numerous genetic disorders and
has never been indicated as a result of neonatal
in
sults Thus we argue that the cause of higher risks of
intellectual disability and ASD in children from ICSI
is genetic related
is more
As we know ICSI is intended to prevent fertilization
failure One of
the indications that becomes practi
tioners’ common consideration when suggesting ICSI is
sperm immotility  Despite successes of achieving
pregnancies after ICSI using immotile or morphologic
ally abnormal spermatozoa  reports have sug
gested that the rates of DNA fragmentation in immotile
spermatozoa are higher than in normal spermatozoa
 Furthermore poorquality oocytes advanced ma
ternal age and unexplained infertility have also been
used as indications to perform ICSI  Each of the
previously mentioned indication has also been associated
with higher rates of DNA fragmentation hence this
might be related to neurodevelopmental disorders Study
by Porokhovnik et al correlates infantile autism with el
evated DNA damage degree  thus our findings
might be related to any of these factors
As cryopreservation became more integrated to the
common ART practice nowadays the comparison be
tween children from frozen embryo transfer with chil
dren from fresh embryo transfer was also performed
As previous reports have suggested the risk of ac
quiring DNA fragmentations during cryopreservation
and thawing processes might be associated with re
duced numbers and proportion of trophectoderm cells
 higher prevalence of neurodevelopmental disor
ders in children from frozen embryo transfer is ex
pected To our
results
showed that there are no significant differences be
tween the risks of neurodevelopmental disorders in
children from frozen embryo transfer compared to
the risk in children from fresh embryo transfer Previ
ous studies also reported that frozen embryo transfer
resulted in increased live birth rate and higher neo
natal birth body weight  The improvement of
cryopreservation techniques such as vitrification and
elective frozen embryo transfer might result in better
pregnancy and neonatal outcome 
Limitations
The present study has several limitations First the num
ber of studies that reported neurodevelopmental out
comes from different ART procedures is limited This
limitation correlates with the limited number of patients
and the possibilities that some of the findings might be
population specific Secondly singleton and multiple
births could not be differentiated in some studies Previ
ous studies suggested that multiple pregnancy carries
higher risks of prematurity and low birth body weight
 both could potentially contribute to the risks of
neurodevelopmental disorders
the
matched casecontrol studies could introduce potential
conclusion bias on the absolute number of children at
risk in the normal population To overcome all of these
limitations future studies that involve larger populations
with sufficient background information are required
Conclusion
In conclusion children from ART have a higher risk of
acquiring cerebral palsy than children from natural con
ceptions This increased risk is possibly associated with
confounding factors
including preterm birth and low
body birth weight Based on this finding it is reasonable
to perform deliveries of children from ART at facilities
with available neonatal intensive care unit  thus
treatment of potential cerebral insults after birth can be
optimized Furthermore children from ICSI carry higher
risks of
intellectual disability and ASD than children
from conventional IVF These findings suggest the im
portance of
longterm followup and preimplantation
genetic screening particularly in fertilizations by ICSI
Lastly cryopreservation and thawing of embryos did not
seem to cause increases in any risks of neurodevelop
mental disorders therefore freezeall strategy seemed
plausible
