This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and MetaAnalyses  checklist  To 
be included in this review a study met the following criteria 1 It was 
published in a peerreviewed journal 2 The exposure was ambient 
criteria  air pollution or airborne toxics thus indoor airborne 
chemical and secondhand smoking exposures were not included 3 The 
health outcome was ASD or related subphenotypes 4 It was empirical 
which  excluded  reviews  comments  replies  protocols  conceptual 
studies and letters to the editor 5 The study was in humans thus 
animal studies were not included 6 The study was published in English 
and 7 Effect modification was evaluated in stratified analyses or in 
interactions 
22 Search strategy and study selection 
We  identified  articles  published  in  peerreviewed  journals  from 
PubMed and Embase database The database search was conducted on 
May 1st 2021 The search keywords were a combination of terms for 
exposures  and  health  outcomes  For  exposures  keywords  were  “air 
pollutants”  “air pollution”  “particulate matter”  “PM”  “nitrogen di
oxide” “NO2” “nitrogen oxide” “NO” “ozone” “O3” “SulfurSulfur 
dioxide”  “SO2”  “carbon monoxide”  “CO”  “vehicle emissions” and 
“traffic” For outcomes key terms were  “autism spectrum disorder” 
“ASD” “autistic” “pervasive developmental disorder” “PDD” “PDD 
NOS” and “Asperger Syndrome” The search syntaxes for the two da
tabases were shown in Supplementary Table S1 and Table S2 We also 
reviewed references cited in eligible studies to identify additional arti
cles for inclusion no additional eligible publications were added from 
the references 
The study selection was conducted in two steps Step 1 involved 
screening titles and abstracts to identify human studies of ambient air 
pollution and ASD Studies were identified sequentially according to the 
first six eligibility criteria  If a study failed to meet an 
eligibility  criterion  there  was  no  further  review  of  other  inclusion 
criteria For Step 2 fulltext was reviewed to select articles reporting 
effect modification or interactions of air pollution with other factors in 
association with ASD In this step all 7 inclusion criteria were evaluated 
Because there were few studies with comparable exposures and effect 
modifiers we did not conduct a metaanalysis 
23 Data extraction 
2 Methods 
21 Eligibility criteria 
Two major categories of data were extracted from studies selected 
The first included study characteristics including year study design 
study population sample size exposure measurement outcome ascer
tainment modifiers and covariates The second focused on effect sizes 
for effect modification For stratified analyses the estimated effect size 
and corresponding confidence interval from each modifying category 
were recorded When interactions were tested results of additive and 
multiplicative tests were also extracted 
24 Assessment of risk of bias 
For each study the assessment of risk of bias was based on the nine 
point NewcastleOttawa Quality Assessment Scale  Wells et al 
2014 For casecontrol studies the scale consists of three evaluation 
sections corresponding to  the possibility of bias in selection of cases 
and controls   comparability of cases and controls and 
treatment of confounders on the basis of study design or data analysis 2 
points and  the quality and completeness of exposure assessment 3 
points  For  cohort studies the  three  sections correspond  to   the 
assessment  of  possible  bias  in  the  selection  of  both  exposed  and 
25 Analytical approach 
Effect modifiers evaluated based on the literature review included 
 child’s sex  markers for socioeconomic status maternal educa
tion race and neighborhood deprivation and other characteristics from 
census data  maternal factors nutrition maternal immune activa
tors such as diabetes and  genetics We summarized the results of 
effect modification from each study 
Additive or multiplicative interaction effects between the modifier 
and air pollution exposure were reported if available For studies that 
showed only results from stratified analyses by susceptibility factors 
evaluation  of  effect  modification  was  based  on  comparison  of  each 
subgroup’s effect size as described by Altman and Bland  We 
calculated  the  original  coefficients  and  standard errors  from  the  re
ported odd ratios or hazard ratios and corresponding 95 confidence 
intervals reported in most studies The difference between the original 
regression coefficients was assessed with the Wald test using the pooled 
standard error from the two strata An example is presented in Supple
mentary Table S4 
3 Results 
31 Study selection 
Studies identified and then excluded at each step of selection are 
shown in the PRISMA flow chart  were identified through 
the database search of which 296 were duplicates The remaining 976 
articles were screened by title and abstract and 937 publications that 
were  not  empirical  human  studies  on  the  association  between  air 
pollution and ASD were excluded A total of 39 articles studied the as
sociation between ambient air pollution and ASD were identified In the 
fulltext assessment another 20 studies were excluded because they did 
not examine any effect modifiers  A total of 
19 publications were included in this review

32 Study characteristics 
A description of the 19 included studies is shown in Supplementary 
Table S6 All studies that evaluated effect modification were published 
since 2010 The majority  were conducted in the United States 
including 7 based on populations in California There were four studies 
from  other  countries  one  each  from  Sweden  Israel  Denmark  and 
Canada Studies from other countries were not included because they 
did not examine effect modifiers There were 13 casecontrol studies 4 
cohort studies and 2 ecological studies The most widely examined air 
pollutant was particulate matter  11 publications studied the effect 
of PM25 and 10 studied PM10 Nitrogen oxides  were 
examined in 12 articles ozone  in 6 studies sulfur dioxide  in 1 
study and carbon monoxide  in 1 study Nine studies examined 
more than one regulated air pollutant In addition three studies exam
ined effects of the nearroadway air pollution mixture and 5 examined 
effects  of  airborne  toxicants  Except  for  two  ecological  studies  all 
studies examined exposure during pregnancy  and 10 of these 
assessed trimesterspecific effects Five studies assessed prepregnancy 
effects  and  7  examined  effects  of  postnatal  exposure  Methods  for 
ASD ascertainment were varied including detailed clinical and neuro
psychological evaluations extraction from electronic medical records 
and questionnaire surveys Six studies further divided ASD into sub 
phenotypes based on comorbidities 
33 Risk of bias 
Both the NOS and the navigation guide from Lam et al  pro
vided criteria for assessing bias in individual level observational studies 
Therefore two ecological studies potentially subject to ecological fal
lacy were excluded from the assessment of bias NOS scores the last 
column of Supplementary Table S6 for all the 17 observational studies 
with individual level data passed the cutoff score of 7 for acceptable 
quality 
The assessment of risk of bias corresponding to the guide from Lam is 
shown in Supplementary Table S7 Most studies were rated as “low” or 
“probably low”  on all 6 criteria for bias with some exceptions For 
example the source population representativeness had “probably high” 
bias in Kalkbrenner et al  because the study population was 

volunteers Three studies of air toxics were rated as “probably high” risk 
of exposure misclassification bias because this dataset has high uncer
tainty in the exposure estimates  
Among the effect modifiers the measure of folic acid intake in Goodrich 
et al  had “probably high” bias because the assessment of folic 
acid intake was based on retrospective recall in a telephone interview 
The potential misclassification of urbanicity in Kalkbrenner et al  
was classified as “probably high” because there was no description of 
how the “urbanicity” modifier was defined or obtained 
34 Effect measure modifiers 
341 Social and demographic features 
A total of 11 papers  
examined effect modification by child’s sex 3 examined modification by 
maternal or family education level Two studies assessed variation in air 
pollution effects by neighborhood deprivation and one by urbanicity 
Effect modification by race and income were only evaluated in the two 
ecological studies  
• Child’s sex 
Most studies reported that the effect estimates of early life exposures 
to both PM10 and PM25 were stronger in boys than in girls  
Only Jo et al found that the hazard ratio in boys for the first 
trimester average PM25  was statisti
cally different from that in girls  
pinteraction  003 Larger but not significantly different PM25 effects 
were observed in boys in the third trimester for the entire pregnancy 
average exposure and during the first year of life 
ASDassociated sex interactions with other regulated pollutants were 
not statistically significant  One study found no association of 
NO2 during pregnancy with ASD risk in girls OR  100 95 CI 086 
116 and a positive effect in boys  but 
interaction  was  not  significant    NO  exposure 
during pregnancy had a similar pattern of interactions with sex in the 
same study Another study found average NO2 exposure during preg
nancy was associated with increased risk in girls OR  146 95 CI

b P interaction column lists the qualitative or quantitative test results of interaction terms reported in each study “Not reported” indicates the authors did not report 
interaction Pvalue either qualitatively or quantitatively 
c Based on method described by Altman and Bland  An example of calculation is shown in Table S4 

 
Three studies  demonstrated 
no consistent pattern of effect modification of the air pollutionASD 
association by education level  Becerra et al  found 
that the effect of trafficrelated NO2 during pregnancy on ASD was sta
tistically significantly higher in children whose mothers did not grad
uate from high school than in children whose mothers graduated high 
school However in the same study stronger associations of CO and NO2 
exposure during pregnancy were observed in children with maternal 
education level greater than high school compared with those with less 
than high school and these differences in point estimates were statis
tically  significant  A  Swedish  study  reported  that  associations  of 
trafficrelated NOx and PM10 exposure during pregnancy and the first 
year of life were stronger in the more educated subgroup with more 
than 12 years of education but neither main effects nor interactions 
were statistically significant  An ecological study on 
air  toxics  found  that  the  association  of  mercury  with  ASD  risk  was 
significantly higher in census tracts with belowaverage percentage of 
college educated households   
• Neighborhood characteristics 
Two casecontrol studies examined the modifying effect of neigh
borhood deprivation based on an index including income education 
unemployment and other socioeconomic characteristics in small socio
economically homogeneous areas  One US study found that 
children living in the most deprived neighborhoods had stronger ASD 
associations with PM25  during the first year 
of  life   
 When modeling PM25 as a continuous variable 
the interaction between neighborhood deprivation level also was not 
significant in the same study  In contrast a Swedish study 
found that trafficrelated NOx and PM10 exposure during the first year of 
life were more strongly associated with ASD in less deprived neighbor
hoods   Kalkbrenner et al 
 reported that there were no modifying effects of census tract 
urbanicity  on the association of 
air toxics with ASD Dickerson et al  found that children from 
census tracts with higher poverty rates had stronger associations of a 
combined metals index with ASD  
• Race 
Racial differences in effects were examined in only one ecological 
study in which there was an association of ASD with unhealthy air 
quality  only among Asians which was not significant OR

founders  
342 Maternal factors 
Two studies reported effect modification by maternal factors one for 
folic acid intake and one for maternal diabetes In a casecontrol study 
Goodrich et al  found that children of mothers with low folic acid 
intake during the first trimester  had 
stronger associations of ASD with NO2 than mothers with sufficient folic 
acid intake  
 Jo et al  reported increased ASD risk associated with 
first trimester O3  exposure among mothers with gestational diabetes 
mellitus  diagnosed 24 weeks’ gestation adjusted HR 150 per 
157 ppb O3  compared to mothers without dia
betes No O3 associations with ASD were observed among children of 
mothers with later onset GDM or with preexisting diabetes 
343 Genetic factors 
Two  studies  of  interactions  with  genetic  factors  were  identified 
 Kim et al  examined 15 interactions between 3 types of 
copy number variation  burden  
and  5  air  pollutants  NO2  O3  PM25  and  PM10  and  nearroadway 
pollution Only interactions of O3  exposures during pregnancy per 
62 ppb with CNV duplication burden per increase of 1356513 base 
pairs OR  155  and with total CNV burden OR 
136  were significant In another study ASD risk 
was increased in association with an interaction of exposure to high 
PM10 NO2 and dispersionmodeled nearroadway pollution dichoto
mized at the 75th percentile of each distribution with the MET receptor 
tyrosine kinase rs CC genotype compared to MET CG or GG 
genotype  
4 Discussion 
Since Windham et al  published the first study of the associ
ation between prenatal air toxics and the risk of ASD in 2006 more than 
30 papers have examined air pollutionASD association in diverse pop
ulations and regions In the last decade studies have begun to examine 
susceptibility to air pollution This approach has the potential to identify 
susceptible populations and potentially to explain some inconsistency in 
the main effects of air pollution However we found only limited evi
dence  that  male  sex  low  education  maternal  folate  deficiency  and 
gestational diabetes and child’s copy number and MET receptor tyro
sine kinase genotypic variation may increase risk of ASD associated with 
air pollution There were few studies that examined each susceptibility 
characteristic except sex of the child and little consistency of findings 
across studies 
41 Susceptibility by sex 
The most widely examined effect modifier was child’s sex In gen
eral epidemiological studies found stronger effects of early life PM25 
and air toxics exposure on the risk of ASD in boys than girls These 
findings  are  consistent  with  toxicological  studies  showing  that  the 
activation of microglial cells induced by neuroinflammation may lead to 
synapse dysfunction involved in ASD Bolton et al 2017 Hammond 
et al 2018 Males may be more sensitive to PM or other inflammatory 
insults because they have more microglia than females during gesta
tional  and  early  postnatal  periods    An 
alternative explanation is that higher prenatal testosterone levels during 
fetal  brain  development  activate  microglia  making  males  more 
vulnerable  to air  pollutants  or other  inflammatory insults  Auyeung 
et al 2013 McCarthy 2016 In human studies the small sample of 
girls in many studies of air pollution and ASD limited ability to detect 
small differences between effects in boys and girls For example one 
study with 441 ASD cases in girls reported larger effect estimates in boys 
boys  than in girls HR  090 95 CI 
076 107 pinteraction  003  In another study a 
considerably larger PM25 effect in boys

c Based on method described by Altman and Bland  An example of calculation is shown in Table S4 
d Additive interactions were examined based on dichotomized pregnancy or postpregnancy PM25 concentrations  No significant 
additive interactions were found at 005 alpha level 
than in girls  was not significantly 
different  but there were only 23 girls with ASD 
 
42 Susceptibility by socioeconomic characteristics 
Sparse and inconsistent findings limit our ability to draw conclusions 
about how SES modifies air pollution effects For example Becerra et al 
showed that the associations of NO2 with ASD were stronger for children 
of mothers without high school degrees but for CO stronger associations 
were observed among children of better educated women Reasons for 
these findings are unclear However in general larger effects among 
lower educated mothers might be expected if loweducated mothers 
were more likely to be at home  and so residential 
exposure  estimates  during  pregnancy  were  more  accurate  More 
educated mothers may be more likely to work in indoor office jobs and 
in  buildings  that  filter  ambient  pollution  and  therefore  have  little 
exposure Highly educated mothers may be more likely to have diets 
supplemented with folate or rich in antioxidants that could diminish the 
effect of air pollution  One potential 
explanation for why smaller effects of ambient air pollution might be 
observed in children of less educated mothers comes from the cumula
tive risk model based on a hypothesis that large effects of cooccurring 
other relatively high adverse exposures or social stressors may result in 
little additional risk from ambient air pollution  
One challenge in assessing effects of SES is that SES can have inde
pendent effects at both the individual level and the area level O’Neill 
et al 2003 Neighborhood SES markers such as average education 
income employment rates of poverty or home values in the census tract 
have  sometimes  been  found  to  more  strongly  modify  effects  of  air 
pollution on cardiovascular outcomes than individual level education 
occupation and income  According to the  “double 
jeopardy” conceptual model  in addition to the 

generally  greater  concentrations  of  air  pollution  associated  with 
neighborhood SES deprived neighborhoods may be lacking in features 
such as healthy food availability and green space contributing to a 
higher risk of chronic conditions such as diabetes and obesity which 
may increase susceptibility to ambient pollutants 
43 Susceptibility by maternal health conditions and nutrition intake 
One study reported that increased ASD risk was associated with first 
trimester O3 among mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus  
diagnosed before 24 weeks’ gestation  Diabetes is one 
example of many conditions that cause maternal immune activation 
 including viral and bacterial infections Jiang et al 2016 Zerbo 
et al 2013 asthma L A Croen Grether Yoshida Odouli and Van de 
Water 2005 and preeclampsia  that have been 
associated with higher risk of ASD Common biological pathways of 
effects  of  MIA  O3  and  PM25  include  systemic  inflammation  and 
oxidative  stress  that  are  associated  with  increased  reactive  oxygen 
species in the placenta and fetus Bonini and Sargis 2018 Brown et al 
2001 Chen and Lippmann 2009 Cuffe et al 2017 Thus it is bio
logically plausible to hypothesize that the presence of MIA during crit
ical  time  windows  may  have  synergistic  effects  with  earlylife  air 
pollution on ASD a “second hit” resulting in disease Bilbo et al 2018 
Estes and McAllister 2016 This hypothesis has the potential to identify 
new approaches to prevention based either on treatment for example 
dietary  approaches  to  reducing  gestational  diabetes  in  addition  to 
regulation  of  pollutant  levels  Parenthetically  in  the  United  States 
regulated air pollutant exposure has been declining during the period of 
increasing  rates  of  ASD    Therefore  it  is  not 
plausible that these air pollutant exposures alone are increasing the risk 
of ASD However increasing prevalence of maternal characteristics such 
as gestational diabetes that are known risk factors for ASD Xiang et al 
2015 have the potential to increase the fraction of ASD attributable to

2012 WisniowieckaKowalnik and Nowakowska 2019 However we 
identified only two studies that examined geneenvironment interaction 
 on the risk of ASD 
CNV  duplication  and  deletion  burden  increased  the  prenatal  ozone 
exposure association with ASD risk in children  A few 
animal  studies  have  provided  evidence  for  ozoneinduced  oxidative 
stress and autismlike behavior Bignami et al 1994 Block et al 2012 
Sorace et al 2001 In humans oxidative stress is a key feature of the 
ASD phenotype  It is possible that 
CNVs contribute to genes altering reactive oxygen species Kushima 
et  al  2018  Thus  CNVs  and  prenatal  air  pollution  exposure  can 
potentially share common biological pathways leading to ASD Another 
study found interactions of a specific functional polymorphism MET 
receptor  tyrosine  kinase  rs  CC  genotype  with  prenatal 
nearroadway air pollution and regional PM25 PM10 and NO2 Genetic 
studies have shown that children with MET CC genotype had decreased 
expression  of  MET  protein  in  brain  which  is  associated  with  ASD 
 Animal experiments have 
also  shown  that  prenatal  exposure  to  PAH  a  component  of 
trafficrelated air pollution and PM causes both decreased MET protein 
expression in the brain and autismlike behavior in mouse offspring 
 Therefore it is plausible that decreased MET pro
tein expression is a biological pathway common to air pollution expo
sures and ASD and MET genotype may play a role in the air pollution 
association with ASD Future studies may investigate the interaction 
between air pollution and ASD polygenic risk 
One reason for the paucity of research on the interaction between 
genes and air pollution is that obtaining both genetic and environmental 
data for the same study population is expensive and time consuming 
  Opportunities  exist  for  assigning  earlylife  air 

Overall most studies included in this review were rated as “low” or 
“probably low” in risk of bias especially for the relatively low bias in the 
measurements of air pollution and of effect modifiers lending credibility 
to  the  effects  observed  However  some  limitations  of  these  studies 
emerged during the review 
Large sample size is required to observe interaction effects for rela
tively uncommon diseases like ASD Studies of air pollutionsex inter
action  generally  did  not  identify  statistically  significant  effects 
potentially due to the small proportion of ASD cases in girls reducing the 
power to identify interactions In the US additional studies outside 
California could make the results more representative Future reviews 
might  also  include  studies  of  continuous  measures  of  autistic  traits 
which may allow for detection of subtle effect modification in smaller 
sample  sizes  and  reduce  potential  bias  due  to  disparities  in  disease 
diagnosis by sociodemographic characteristics 
The role of effect modification was usually not the main research 
hypothesis for the studies reviewed thus the reported interactions may 
reflect selective reporting bias The absence of a standard approach to 
reporting  results  of  effect  modification  is  another  limitation  Some 
studies only reported the results of stratified analyses Others reported 
the pvalues of multiplicative interaction terms from statistical models 
Only a few articles assessed interaction on both the additive and mul
tiplicative scale Reporting risk measures relative risks odds ratios 
hazard ratios for each stratum of exposure and the interaction on both 
additive and multiplicative scales is good practice Knol and Vander
Weele 2012 The studies by Goodrich et al  and McGuinn et al 
  are  examples  of  reporting  additive  and  multiplicative  in
teractions Finally most studies do not explicitly describe the theoretical 
or conceptual frameworks supporting the study hypothesis and design 
for assessing effect modification 
46 Strengths and limitations of this review 
To our knowledge this is the first systematic review summarizing the 
evidence on effect modifiers of the association between air pollution and 
the risk of ASD The review followed the PRISMA checklist The litera
ture search was based on two most widely used databases PubMed and 
Embase The data extraction was thorough including complementary 
results reported in supplementary materials Rigorous assessment of risk 
of bias was conducted considering population representativeness the 
potential for misclassification of exposure ASD outcome effect modi
fiers and the potential for selective reporting bias 
Because there were relatively few studies and results were not uni
formly consistent we did not attempt to conduct metaanalyses and 
there were few definitive conclusions that could be drawn about how the 
association between air pollution and ASD was modified by the factors 
studied We only included peerreviewed studies published in English It 
is possible that additional relevant information might be available in 
book chapters nonEnglish and grey literature 
5 Conclusions 
This review synthesized studies of potential effect modifiers of the 
association between ambient air pollution and the risk of ASD Maternal 
gestational diabetes insufficient folic acid intake during pregnancy low 
maternal  education  child  male  sex  and  high  CNV  burden  or  MET 
rs  CC  genotype  may  increase  susceptibility  to  the  effect  of 
prenatal  air  pollution  exposure  on  ASD  risk  However  the  limited 
number of studies on each modifier precludes definitive conclusions 
Additional  investigation  of  these  susceptibility  characteristics  would 
benefit  from  consistent  definitions  across  studies  with  sample  sizes 
sufficient to identify interactions and a priori hypotheses for example 
that exposure to maternal immune activators would increase effects of 
air pollutants on ASD
