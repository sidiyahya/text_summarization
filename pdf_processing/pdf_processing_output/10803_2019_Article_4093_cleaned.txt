reported in two case studies Sandler et al 2000 Rodakis 
2015 However high use of different antibiotics in children 
who subsequently developed autism was shown in a num
ber of observational studies Fallon 2005 Niehus and Lord 
2006 Bittker and Bell 2018 Hypothetically these observed 
effects could be attributable to microbiota alterations trig
gering a disturbed immune response and the release of 
cytokines thus affecting the function of the central nerv
ous system  Recently a number of 
observational studies have assessed a possible association of 
earlylife antibiotic exposure and subsequent development 
of ASD Here we aimed to systematically document avail
able evidence on the association between early life antibiotic 
exposure and the prevalence of ASD later in in childhood
Methods
InclusionExclusion Criteria for the Review
Cohort studies case–control studies and crosssectional 
studies  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  this  review  The 
included  studies  needed  to  investigate  an  association 
between pre andor postnatal antibiotic exposure and sub
sequent diagnosis of ASD We included studies in which 
women during any trimester of pregnancy or infants and
or children underwent antibiotic treatment We focused on 
earlylife antibiotic exposure that preceded a diagnosis of 
ASD which is usually established after the second year of 
life  Studies on antibiotic exposure in 
breastfeeding mothers and subsequent risk of ASD in their 
children were not included Since the hypothesized link 
between ASD and antibiotic use is based on the aforemen
tioned microbiomegutbrain axis mechanism only stud
ies which reported data on systemic andor oral antibiotic 
therapy were taken into an account Any antibiotic types 
and doses as well as any treatment durations and indica
tions were admissible as long as the therapy fulfilled the 
aforementioned criteria Studies that reported data on anti
biotic use collectively  
or that did not report numerical data were excluded Studies 
in which the data on antibiotic use was collected only for the 
purpose of baseline characteristic of participants with no 
analysis of the association between antibiotic use and ASD 
were also excluded
Our outcome of interest was the diagnosis of ASD during 
childhood Studies in which the diagnosis was made accord
ing to established criteria such as those described in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersV 
 as well as stud
ies in which ASD was reported by parents caregivers or 
doctors without any described specific criteria were avail
able for inclusion Studies that reported data on ASD only 
collectively with other neurodevelopmental disorders eg 
together with attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder were 
excluded Only studies that compared children with ASD up 
to 18 years of age to generally healthy children without this 
diagnosis were included
Search Methods
A systematic literature search was performed on 28th of 
August 2018 with no language or publication date restric
tions The databases searched were PubMed Embase and 
PsycINFO After drafting the first version of the manuscript 
we ran a search update on the 11th of December 2018 The 
full search strategies for PubMed and Embase are presented 
in Online Resource 1 Additionally reference lists of identi
fied observational studies and relevant review articles were 
manually screened
Study Selection
Three authorsreviewers  independently 
screened the title of each study identified with the search 
strategy as well as the abstracts of potentially relevant arti
cles Subsequently the full text for each study potentially 
relevant after abstract screening as well as that for studies of 
unclear relevance was retrieved Each author independently 
assessed the eligibility of the articles and in cases of a disa
greement resolved differences by discussion
Data Extraction and Risk of Bias Assessment
Data were extracted with the use of a standard data extrac
tion form The extracted data included study year country 
design population definition of exposure definitions of 
cases and controls  definition of 
outcome  results confounding factors 
and data collection methods We extracted and reported all 
the data using the same terminology as the authors of the 
original articles
Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa 
Scale   in which the reviewers 
assign stars in all predefined bias domains In the com
parability domain the reviewers have to assign 0 1 or 2 
stars on the basis of the number and types of confounding 
factors controlled for Multiple important confounding fac
tors may play a role in studies on the antibioticASD asso
ciation including those related to different demographics 
pregnancyrelated complications mothers’ obstetrical histo
ries child characteristics at birth infections environmental 
exposures and healthcare use  The NOS 
requires the reviewers to assign stars depending on two cho
sen most important factors After the literature search and 
discussion we found no rationale to decide whether any of 
the abovementioned factors was more important than the 
others Therefore we decided to assign zero stars to stud
ies in which no confounding factors were controlled for or 
the adjustment was unclear and two stars to studies which 
controlled for any confounding factors Additionally for 
informative purposes we present confounders identified in 
each study in a separate table We decided to present risk 
of bias only descriptively and no collective score for the 
included studies was counted
Data Analysis
A metaanalysis of the findings was performed if at least two 
studies of the same type  reported the 
adjusted odds ratios  or adjusted hazard ratios  
of ASD being diagnosed in participants exposed to antibi
otics during the same life period  We 
performed the metaanalyses using the Review Manager 53 
software by the Cochrane Collaboration Generic inverse 
variance with the random effects model was used Addition
ally the fixed effects model was applied to see how it would 
influence the results To enable a graphic presentation of the 
findings in studies which didn’t report OR or HR we calcu
lated crude ORsHRs and 95 confidence intervals  
of ASD being diagnosed after antibiotic exposure provided 
the data were sufficient

Results
Overall Characteristics
In total we identified 6820 records by the database search 
and 891 records by reference screening After exclusion 
of duplicates and title and abstract screening the full 
texts of 63 articles were assessed for eligibility Thirty
seven observational studies on risk factors for autism were 
excluded because they did not report antibiotic exposure 
Reasons for exclusion of the remaining 15 studies are 
listed in Online Resource 2 After fulltext assessment 
11 articles ultimately met the inclusion criteria for this 
review The flow diagram of the selection process is pre
sented in Online Resources 3 and 4 present characteristics and 
main results of the included studies Four of those studies 
were cohort studies and seven of them were case–con
trol studies Among the included cohort studies three 
Danish studies Atladottir et al 2012 Wimberley et al 
2018 Axelsson et al 2019 were performed in overlap
ping populations Five studies examined prenatal antibiotic 
exposure five assessed early childhood antibiotic exposure 
and 1 study examined both types of exposure Wimberley 
et al 2018 In the majority of included studies use of any 
antibiotic for any indication and duration and at any dose 
within the defined time period was analyzed Addition
ally all of the cohort studies and two of the case–control 
studies included a number of secondarysensitivity analy
ses taking antibiotic type spectrum timing number of 
courses andor indication into account
Overall three out of four included cohort studies earned a 
maximum number of stars and only one study lost one star 
in one of the NOS domains In contrast all of the case–con
trol studies carried a considerable amount of bias mostly 
concerning case definitions control for confounding factors 
and ascertainment of exposure Details of risk of bias assess
ment for cohort and case–control studies respectively are 
presented in Online Resource 5 Additionally we listed all 
the confounding factors used in adjusted analyses in Online

Prenatal Antibiotic Exposure
Cohort Studies
Prenatal antibiotic exposure as a risk factor for autism was 
examined in two large Danish cohort studies performed 
in overlapping populations The studies involved respec
tively 96736 children including 976 with ASD Atladot
tir et al 2012 and 780547 children including 9352 with 
autism  Population of the first study 
was most likely contained within the population of the sec
ond therefore we didn’t perform a metaanalysis The first 
study reported a borderline significant increase in the risk 
of ASD after use of any antibiotics anytime during preg
nancy adjusted hazard ratio  12 95 confidence 
interval  10–14 A stronger association of prenatal 
antibiotic exposure with the risk of ASD was reported for 
the use of sulfonamides anytime during pregnancy aHR 
15 95 CI 10–22 and use of penicillins during the sec
ond  and third  
trimester Similar results were observed for infantile autism 
 with 
the strongest association reported for the use of macrolides 
anytime during the pregnancy  
Confounding factors controlled for in adjusted model were 
as follows gender maternal age parity maternal smoking 
during pregnancy paternal age parental psychiatric history 
and parents’ educational status
The second study reported a significant positive asso
ciation between exposure to any antibiotic anytime during 
pregnancy and subsequent risk of autism in the offspring 
 The analysis was adjusted 
only for sex and age Assessment of this association was not 
a primary focus of the study and it was only reported as a 
secondary analysis in the supplementary materials
Case–Control Studies
Four of the included case–control studies examined risk of 
ASD after prenatal antibiotic exposure Among them two 
clinicbased studies  
were available for a metaanalysis They were conducted in 
groups of children of 343  and 314 136 
with ASD respectively None of those studies found sig
nificant associations between antibiotic use and ASD with 
pooled odds ratio from random effect model of 124 95 
CI 053–292 tors used for the analysis were not described George et al 
2014 while the second study controlled for a number of 
perinatal gestational and socioeconomic variables Guisso 
et al 2018
In one study conducted in 288 Polish children includ
ing 96 with autism  the results 
were presented as the percent of cases versus percent of con
trols exposed to prenatal antibiotics The univariate model 
revealed significantly higher exposure to antibiotics in the 
autism group  However for unde
scribed reasons the antibiotics were analyzed only collec
tively with other medications in the multivariate model
The last study was performed in 415 Swedish children 
including 206 with ASD  In the sta
tistical model autism was regressed on antibiotic use dur
ing pregnancy The data were presented as logistic regres
sion betas in the form of log odds β  − 015 standard 
error  045 p  005 in regular regression β  178 stand
ard error  104 p  005 in fixed effects regression and 
were reported by the authors as not statistically significant
None of the aforementioned case–control studies investi
gated type of antibiotic duration of antibiotic therapy or its 
timing during pregnancy All ORs and HRs for ASD after 
use of prenatal antibiotics versus nonexposed group are pre
sented graphically in Early Childhood Antibiotic Exposure
Cohort Studies
Early childhood antibiotic exposure as a risk factor for 
autism was examined in three cohort studies One study 
performed in 214834 Canadian children including 2965 
with ASD  reported a trend towards a 
reduced risk of ASD in children exposed to any antibiot
ics during the first year of life after adjusting for relevant 
demographic prenatal perinatal and postnatal factors aHR 
091 95 CI 084–099 Stratifying the analysis by sex and 
region resulted in a statistically significant association in 
males  and in children from 
urban regions  In secondary 
analyses a borderline significance was found for the associa
tion of specific antibiotic groups with ASD namely peni
cillin  and macrolides aHR 
087 95 CI 077–099 The number of antibiotic courses 
and duration of therapy were not associated with ASD risk 
In additional analysis of siblingcontrolled design antibiot
ics use was not associated with risk of developing ASD
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders  493866–3876
Two other cohort studies were nationwide register
based studies of the Danish population Both of these stud
ies derived data from the same registers and covered similar 
time periods so their populations largely overlapped In 
one study in 677403 children including 8267 with autism 
 a slightly increased risk of autism 
was observed in children exposed postnatally to penicillin 
 as well as to broaderspec
trum antibiotics  compared 
to children unexposed to antibiotics in the standard model 
However a significant association was no longer observed 
in the betweenwithin sibling model aHR 105 95 CI 
093–118 and aHR 105 95 CI 095–116 for penicillin 
and broaderspectrum antibiotics respectively In another 
study performed in 780547 children including 9352 with 
autism  the risk of autism increased 
after broadspectrum antibiotic exposure before the age of 
5  Moreover risk of autism 
was higher after exposure to broadspectrum and moder
atespectrum antibiotics anytime during childhood aHR 
151 95 CI 133–172 and aHR 122 95 CI 113–132 
respectively Both of these studies controlled for a range 
of potential confounders including different demographic 
pregnancy and neonatal factors parental psychiatric history 
and parity
Since at least two studies of the same type reported the 
aHR of ASD after antibiotic exposure a metaanalysis was 
feasible However the two Danish studies were performed in 
highly overlapping populations so pooling of their data was 
not justifiable To perform a metaanalysis we used the data 
from the 1 of the 2 Danish studies in which the exposure 
and its timing were consistent with those in the Canadian 
study  Pooling of the data did not yield 
any significant association between antibiotic exposure and 
subsequent diagnosis of ASD either in the standard model 
 or in 
the sibling model summary effect estimate 105 95 CI 
096–114 both in random effects  and fixed 
effects analysis
Case–Control Studies
Three case–control studies examined association between 
ASD and childhood antibiotic exposure One internet sur
veybased study performed in 1515 children 1001 with 
ASD  which reported the data in 
the form of logistic regression OR found a positive associa
tion between the number of antibiotic courses taken during 
the first 2 years of life and subsequent diagnosis of ASD in 
all performed analyses including the final multifactor model 
 The study controlled for 
age of the child ethnicity maternal education and region
Another study performed in a group of 214 children 73 
with autism  reported crude ORs of 
autism in children exposed postnatally to antibiotics com
pared to unexposed unrelated controls OR 243 95 CI 
09–652 and unexposed healthy siblings OR 203 95 
CI 040–91 Additionally a multivariable modeling of data 
was performed with use of the AutoCM artificial neural net
work—a method that does not generate numerical results but 
rather provides a map of associations of strength between all 
variables in the data set According to the authors’ interpre
tation the proximity of ‘early antibiotic use’ to the ‘autism 
node’ observed on the map may suggest a significant asso
ciation between the two
In one case–control study involving 99 children 75 with 
autismASD  the mean number of 
antibiotic courses taken before the age of 2 years was sig
nificantly higher in the autismASD group compared to the 
control group  Data provided by the 
authors were insufficient to calculate ORs
None of these case–control studies assessed specific types 
of antibiotics nor the duration of therapy within the analyses 
ORs and HRs of ASD in exposed versus unexposed groups 
for these studies are presented on Discussion
In this review on pre and postnatal antibiotic exposure and 
subsequent risk of autismASD a total of 11 observational 
studies were included In two identified cohort studies on 
prenatal antibiotic exposure performed in overlapping pop
ulations a slightly increased risk of ASDinfantile autism 
after the use of various antibiotics was observed However 
3 of 4 identified case–control studies did not report any sig
nificant association between prenatal antibiotic exposure 
and autism risk whereas one reported a positive association 
based only on univariate analysis Three identified cohort 
studies on early childhood antibiotic exposure reported con
flicting evidence In one cohort study a small trend towards 
a reduced risk of ASD in infants exposed to various antibi
otics in their first year of life was observed which was not 
significant in secondary analyses based on siblingcontrolled 
design In another cohort study a borderline increased 
risk of ASD was observed with exposure to certain types 
of antibiotics in a standard model but no association was 
observed in a betweenwithin sibling model Finally in the 
third study on a cohort overlapping with the previous one a 
significantly higher risk of autism after exposure to various 
classes of antibiotics was observed Data from case–control 
studies on antibiotic exposure during childhood were more 
consistent All three of them reported significant positive 
associations between antibiotic use and later ASD diagnosis
To our knowledge no previous systematic review has 
examined antibiotic use during pregnancy and early child
hood as a potential risk factor for ASD A number of meta
analyses have reported data on various infections preced
ing ASD diagnosis  and some 
have found significant positive associations with infections 
occurring during pregnancy Jiang et al 2016 Gardener 
et al 2009 Additionally one of those systematic reviews 
reported increased risk of ASD after prenatal exposure to 
different medications including antibiotics which were 
however not assessed separately  In 
another metaanalysis no associations between early post
natal infections and subsequent risk of ASD were found 
 On the other hand some observa
tional studies have found evidence of a higher risk of mental 
disorders after various infections in older children and in 
adults  Recently 
more scientific attention is being drawn towards effects of 
earlylife antibiotic exposure on longterm health outcomes 
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders  493866–3876
including reports of its negative influence on neurocognitive 
development  and risk of obesity 

The main strength of this review is its novelty as no 
previous systematic review has focused on the association 
between earlylife antibiotic exposure and ASD Our study 
utilized a broad search strategy complemented by an exten
sive reference hand search so the possibility of missing 
important published data is low A relatively narrow clini
cal question allowed us to focus in detail on the included 
studies and enabled a clear and meticulous presentation of 
findings However this review also has considerable limita
tions Compared to the number of other potential environ
mental risk factors for ASD antibiotic exposure turned out 
to be rarely assessed Wang et al 2017 Modabbernia et al 
2017 Thus only 11 studies were finally included in the 
review the majority of which were of case–control design 
After division into groups depending on study type and tim
ing of exposure small groups of 2 to 4 studies were created 
Methods of data reporting in these studies were heterogene
ous further limiting the capacity to perform either qualita
tive or quantitative synthesis of the data Moreover each 
of the included case–control studies was characterized by a 
significant potential risk of bias Another limitation of this 
study is the inclusion of only published data creating a risk 
of publication bias Finally we excluded a number of studies 
in which infections were explored as potential risk factors 
for ASD Some types of these infections are almost always 
treated with antibiotics eg urinary tract infections dur
ing pregnancy severe infections in newborns so we could 
have assumed them to be a proxy for antibiotic exposure 
However we decided to use only direct data on exposure
Results of the included studies do not provide conclusive 
evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal antibiotic 
exposure is associated with ASD Although a number of 
positive associations was reported in two large cohorts Atl
adottir et al 2012 Wimberley et al 2018 their popula
tions were largely overlapping so they cannot be treated as 
independent studies for the purpose of this review Moreo
ver authors of the study with borderline significant results 
 emphasize that within their analysis 
they made 106 comparisons with no adjustments for multi
ple testing so this borderline significant association between 
prenatal antibiotic exposure and ASD could have been a 
chance finding While this study was specifically designed 
to examine prenatal risk factors of autism and tested for a 
wide range of potential confounders the other one focused 
on postnatal factors and hardly performed any adjustment 
in the prenatal exposure analysis Because of that in our 
opinion the results of the former study are more meaningful
On the other hand all of the case–control studies reported 
no association between prenatal antibiotic exposure and 
ASD except for one that reported higher risk of autism in 
exposed patients  However 
this study was performed in a relatively small group of chil
dren and strangely its finding concerning antibiotic expo
sure was not explored in a multivariate analysis Moreover 
compared to the literature Santos et al 2010 de Jonge 
et al 2014 an unexpectedly low percentage of women in 
the control group  was reported to have used antibiot
ics during pregnancy which may suggest a bias within the 
exposure data
Results of studies on postnatal antibiotic exposure are 
conflicting One cohort study reported a reduced risk of 
ASD in children after antibiotic use  
However since the main model was based only on data from 
administrative databases the authors performed second
ary analyses based on a siblingcontrolled design In those 
analyses antibiotic use was not associated with the risk of 
developing ASD hence the authors concluded that the mar
ginal association observed in the main model was unlikely 
to be meaningful In another cohort study Axelsson et al 
2019 the betweenwithin sibling design analysis did not 
confirm the findings from the standard design analysis of 
higher ASD risk after use of certain types of antibiotics We 
used data from these two studies to perform a metaanalysis 
and its results revealed no significant association The final 
included cohort study  reported a 
positive association between postnatal antibiotic exposure 
and autism risk However since its population largely over
lapped with that of the previous cohort the two cannot be 
treated as independent studies for the purpose of this sys
tematic review Besides the lack of a sibling analysis in the 
latter cohort the difference in results might have originated 
from the differences in the exposure assessment The authors 
of the latter study defined ‘antibiotic use preceding the diag
nosis of autism’ as the antibiotic received before the first 
diagnosis of autism registered in the national healthcare 
databases Median age for the first autism diagnosis in this 
study was 71 years which is much later than both median 
age of ASD diagnosis reported in the literature and median 
age of first developmental concerns in ASD children Baio 
et al 2018 Therefore even for the subgroup of children 
exposed to antibiotics before fifth birthday it is unclear if the 
symptoms of autism were absent before the first antibiotic 
administration In our opinion this might have introduced 
considerable bias
All of the remaining case–control studies reported a posi
tive association between postnatal antibiotic exposure and 
ASD All of these studies were characterized by consider
able potential sources of bias including small sample sizes 
 selfselection 
bias  reflect
ing differences between those who choose to participate in 
a study and those who do not potentially biased control 
group selection  
andor lack of verification if the ASD diagnosis in the case 
group was made by a professional  
Also in all of these studies the exposure data were based 
on parental reports so a risk of recall bias  
especially overreporting the exposure in ASD groups and 
underreporting in control groups cannot be ruled out
Data on specific antibiotic types and risk of ASD are also 
inconsistent In one study an increased risk of ASD was 
reported after prenatal exposure to sulfonamides penicil
lins and macrolides but not cephalosporins Atladottir et al 
2012 This is consistent with the evidence that macrolides 
induce distinctive changes in the microbiome composition of 
children  On the other hand expected 
microbiota alterations after the use of cephalosporins should 
be at least as strong as those after use of penicillins due to 
cephalosporins’ broader spectrum Biedermann and Rogler 
2015 Accordingly another study reported a stronger asso
ciation between ASD and both pre and postnatal exposure 
to broad spectrum antibiotics cephalosporins tetracycline 
trimethoprimsulfonamide combination aminoglycosides 
and quinolones compared to moderatespectrum antibiot
ics  However no significant asso
ciations were found between autism risk and exposure to 
narrowspectrum antibiotics including macrolides In two 
other cohort studies no significant associations between 
ASD and individual types of antibiotics were described 
 Individual anti
biotic types were analyzed and reported differently in each 
of the studies included in our systematic review therefore 
a metaanalysis was not possible According to the avail
able evidence some patterns of microbiota composition in 
individuals with ASD have been identified mostly regarding 
the abundance of different Clostridia and Bacteroidetes spe
cies and an altered BacteroidetesFirmicutes ratio Rosenfeld 
2015 Such changes may be induced both by macrolides 
and broadspectrum antibiotics  On 
the other hand microbiota alterations in different individuals 
might not follow a specific pattern even after use of the same 
antibiotic  Apart from the disturbance 
of the microbiomegutbrain axis to our knowledge no well
documented alternative explanations for the antibioticASD 
association have been proposed
A question concerning all of the included studies is the 
difficulty in differentiating whether the observed effects 
were due to the antibiotics themselves or were due to the 
antibiotics acting as a proxy or mediator of an underlying 
infection Only two of the included studies controlled for 
infections occurring during the same period as antibiotic 
exposure  None 
of the included studies investigated differences in risk of 
autism resulting from specific indications for antibiotic ther
apy Three included studies reported a higher risk of autism 
after maternal respiratory infections Atladottir et al 2012 
George et al 2014 fever episodes and influenza Atladottir 
et al 2012 or “infections” in general  
two studies found significant positive associations between 
early childhood otitis media episodes and autism Wimber
ley et al 2018 Niehus and Lord 2006 Such associations 
of prenatal and earlylife infections with autism have been 
documented before  
and they may also be supported by underlying biological 
mechanisms Singh 2009 Ponzio et al 2007 Rosenhall 
et al 1999
All of the included studies in which the assessment of 
exposure was based on parental reports collected after diag
nosis of ASD have the possibility of recall bias Knowledge 
of a variety of potential exposures that are considered as 
risk factors for ASD is common among parents of children 
with ASD  thus they may tend to ana
lyze the previous medical history of their children more and 
report medication use more often than parents of the control 
children This is a similar effect to the one observed after 
past claims of the supposed vaccinationautism association 
 This may suggest a greater reliability 
of antibiotic exposure data collected prospectively or derived 
from medical records
Yet another problem in the interpretation of possible 
antibioticASD associations is the fact that despite stable 
antibiotic use in Europe and USA in recent years Euro
pean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 2018 Klein 
et al 2018 the prevalence of ASD is actually rising in these 
regions  Nevertheless given the hetero
geneous etiology of autism it is difficult to exclude the pos
sibility that reduced antibiotic use is outweighed by other 
environmental factors contributing to ASD risk
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders  493866–3876
Conclusions
Currently available data from observational studies do 
not conclusively support the hypothesis that prenatal or 
postnatal exposure to antibiotics as a group is a risk fac
tor for ASD However a portion of the results from large 
cohort studies may suggest a possible trend towards higher 
risk of ASD after use of certain types of antibiotics More 
studies most preferably of a prospective cohort design 
controlling adequately for potential confounding factors 
including infections are needed to verify this association
