more children are being diagnosed with ASD The overall preva
lence of ASD increased from 11 in 2012 to 17 in 2014 based on
an analysis of medical and school records of 8yearolds from 11
monitoring sites across the US Baio et al 2018 Dawson and
Bernier 2013 US EPA 2013 Some of the increase in the preva
lence of ASD may be related to increased monitoring and a
broadening of diagnostic criteria Rice et al 2012 Dawson and
Bernier 2013
It is unclear whether and to what extent environmental factors
have contributed to the recent increase in ASD Previous studies
suggested that both genetic and environmental factors might play a
role in ASD  One environmental risk factor
of interest in the etiology of ASD is exposure to ambient air
pollution There are six common air pollutants called criteria pol
lutants identiﬁed by the US Clean Air Act of 1970 groundlevel
ozone  lead particulate matter  carbon monoxide
 nitrogen dioxide  and sulfur dioxide  which are
the only air pollutants under national air quality standards
PM is a complex mixture classiﬁed by size into PM25 25 mm in
diameter and PM10  that vary by place and time
depending on local industries and infrastructure Main emission
sources of the others have been known chemical reactions trans
portation and other combustion products Roberts et al 2013
Volk et al 2011 2013 Talbott et al 2015ab US EPA 2018
While a few studies in Europe have reported no association
 a number
of studies in the US and other countries have reported associations
between maternal exposure to ambient air pollution and ASD in
children Volk et al 2011 2013 Becerra et al 2013 Roberts et al
2013 Kalkbrenner et al 2010 2015 Raz et al 2015 Talbott et al
2015a The different ﬁndings may be related to several factors ASD
ascertainment method air pollutant and study population The
European studies took into account autistic traits and also exam
ined NOx and PM10 instead of NO2 and PM25 or multicountries
which would be more heterogeneous than a single country The
differences between US and Europe could be explained by differ
ences on air pollution levels and sources
Even though epidemiologic studies found maternal exposure to
air pollutants associated with the ASD the mechanism underlying
this association was not clearly understood Recent animal exper
iments with mice found that exposure to unhealthy levels of par
ticulate matter during pregnancy could cause subtle changes in the
structure of the cerebral cortex the outer layer of neural tissue of
the cerebrum of the brain as seen in the brains of autistic patients
 A possible mechanism is related to increased
neuroinﬂammation which leads to decreased expression of the
protein reelindwhich activates a signaling pathway required for
proper positioning of neurons in the braindboth events common
with autism 
Some studies on human pregnancy have found that prenatal
exposure to air pollution during the developmental stage of the
central nervous system may be linked to a systemic inﬂammatory
response which could result in neuronal injury Sunyer 2008
Kalkbrenner et al 2015 Kerin et al 2018 Other studies have also
reported that prenatal exposure to environmental toxicants may be
associated with ASD Rossignol et al 2014 Wong et al 2015 Ye
et al 2017 However the relationship between exposure time
and fetal development remains unclear
There have been some differences in ﬁndings and approaches by
previous systematic reviews and metaanalyses Lam et al 2016
FloresPajot et al 2016 Yang et al 2017 Lam et al concluded that
there was limited evidence for associations between overall air
pollution exposure in early life and ASD but they found sufﬁcient
evidence most notably between prenatal exposures to PM25 or
PM10 and ASD FloresPajot et al investigated varied exposure times
H Chun et al  Environmental Pollution 256  113307
and found evidence that prenatal exposure to PM25 and ozone and
postnatal exposure to PM25 and NO2 were associated with ASD
Yang et al pointed out that a semiBayesian logistic model might
improve the plausibility and stability of estimates They discussed
the need for some welldesigned studies with a large sample less
misclassiﬁcation or measurement of individuallevel exposures
and consideration of multiple confounders
For metaanalysis there are four areas for further investigations
regarding associations between air pollutants and ASD develop
ment in children which pollutant 
to what extent  what method ﬁxed vs random effects
model and when  Adverse health effect of
maternal exposures to ambient air pollution on children may vary
according to the exposure time A natural question is if there is a
critical time window of exposure that is more associated with ASD
development in children
In this systematic review we conducted a systematic search of
literature on maternal exposure to ambient air pollution and ASD
since 2007 which resulted in an ultimate focus on PM25 PM10 NO2
and ozone This focus was mainly due to eligible studies’ avail
ability not our preference for the four pollutants We also examined
the exposure time by trimester considering fetal development
during pregnancy
2 Materials and methods
21 Search strategy
The protocol of this study was registered in PROSPERO Chun
et al 2018 No CRD42018104041 A systematic literature search
in Medline Embase and Web of Science was performed using the
combination of Medical Subject Headings  related to ASD
and maternal exposure  to air
pollution since 2007 We included criteria air contaminants haz
ardous air pollutants  and related pollutants eg SO2 NOx
VOCs persistent organic pollutants 
heavy metals  and toxicants  We used
several keywords for HAP with the help of a librarian at the Ottawa
Hospital Searches were limited to studies with an abstract pub
lished in the English language with a publication date between
January 1 2007 and April 30 2019 to focus on recent research
22 Study eligibility criteria
We used Covidence  to screen studies based on
title and abstract Covidence is a Cochrane technology platform that
enables the whole review team to collaborate remotely by keeping
full records of who voted to include a study and capturing reasons
for exclusion so reviewers can resolve any disagreements We
identiﬁed eligible articles for this study using the following inclu
sion criteria
including
ecological casecontrol and cohort studies  study participants
included children andor mothers  ASD diagnosis was made
based on clinical assessments selfreport questionnaires or struc
tured interviews  measure of air pollution exposure or during
conception and pregnancy  or at the time of
birth  or during childhood 
and  information on the sample size and air pollution The
exclusion criteria were  studies that used animal models  full
article not in English and  abstracts case reports comments
reviews conference proceedings or book chapters
23 Data extraction
After reviewing abstracts we shortlisted fulltext articles for
 study design was observational
24 Assessment of risk of bias
Risk of bias was assessed using the NewcastleOttawa Quality
Assessment Scale   and Lam et al’s navi
gation guide  The NOS consists of eight items to evaluate
sources of bias such as deﬁnition and selection of case and controls
adequate sample size comparability of cases and controls on the
basis of the design or analysis and nonresponse rate Studies were
given a maximum of 1 point for each of the seven items and 2
points for comparability only making the maximum score 9 points
Higher scores suggested a lower risk of bias According to Lam
et al’s navigation guide we also rated each study as “high quality”
“moderate quality” and “low quality” in terms of exposure assess
ment selective outcome reporting and conﬁdence in effect esti
mates We set up a cutoff score of 7 with the NOS and “moderate
quality” with the navigation guide for this review study to maintain
low risk of bias
25 Metaanalysis
First we categorized eligible studies by air pollutant PM25
PM10 NO2 and ozone exposure time all the prenatal period and
each trimester separately study design cohort casecontrol
ecological and modelling population covariates and regres
sion The 4 exposure time periods were included to assess time
varying associations Second we derived metaestimates for ASD
associated with the 4 air pollutants We applied both frequentist
and Bayesian approaches for ﬁxed effect model and random effects
model for each air pollutant and each exposure time to calculate
the pooled odds ratios  per 10 units of that pollutant PM25
and PM10 in mgm and NO2 and ozone in parts per billion 
Since we were concerned with the small number of studies
included for each air pollutant we employed a Bayesian random
effects model in addition to frequentist ﬁxed and random effects
models The Bayesian pooling method can reﬂect more uncertainty
of pooled OR than frequentist pooling  For a given
air pollutant we assumed that the observed studyspeciﬁc ORs log
scale were normally distributed with unknown true studyspeciﬁc
mean and variance and that the true studyspeciﬁc means were
normally distributed with unknown air pollutantspeciﬁc mean 
and variance s
i  which indicated the heterogeneity among the
studies
Þ was
limited noninformative priors diffused over a large range for each
mean and standard deviation were applied In this study the me
dian of the posterior distribution of the mean mi will be reported as
the metaanalysis pooled log  along with 95 posterior interval

Since information on both mean  and variance ðs
Various tests for heterogeneity using I2 and Qstatistic with
degrees of freedom as well as the pvalue of the test were done In
addition we included Egger test and Funnel plots to show the
publication bias since publication of positive ﬁndings has been an
important concern in metaanalytic reviews of the literature The
degree of symmetry found in funnel plots indicates absence of
publication bias 
Sensitivity analyses over study design and exposure time were
also undertaken to assess the robustness of the results All

3 Results
31 Search results
Our study selection process following the PRISMA ﬂow chart is
shown in were identiﬁed through the search strategy of which 994 publi
cations were included once duplicates were removed After
excluding studies that were nonhuman or nonair pollutant 62
articles were shortlisted for the fulltext assessment which
resulted in further exclusion of 37 articles for various reasons
Finally 25 eligible articles were included in our review
32 Study characteristics
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the included studies sorted
by publication year The 25 eligible studies were conducted in 11
countries USA  Sweden  Netherlands  Italy  Spain 
Taiwan  China  Canada  Denmark  Iran  and Israel
 While 24 studies were done for a single country a study by
Guxens et al was conducted in the 4 countries in Europe simulta
neously As for study design there were 21 casecontrol studies 3
cohort studies and 1 ecological study While the casecontrol and
cohort designs were based on individual level data the ecological
design used either exposure or ASD occurrence at group level
Studies published between 2007 and 2019 were initially searched
to minimize discrepancy in their ASD deﬁnition and diagnosis
methods considering recent year studies more comparable Of
those studies for 2010e were considered for systematic re
view based on the four selected air pollutants and studies for
2013e were included for metaanalysis based on the exposure
time  given the sudden increase in
the prevalence of ASD that might be related to broadening diag
nostic criteria  This is
desirable for metaanalysis because it reduced betweenstudy dif
ferences related to diagnosis methods
Among the 25 eligible studies 23 with the exception of two on
the postnatal period speciﬁcally assessed prenatal air pollution
and of those 11 included trimesterspeciﬁc analyses The most
commonly assessed air pollutant was PM10 which was included in
14 studies followed by PM25  NO2  ozone
 trafﬁcrelated air pollution  and SO2 3
studies Nineteen studies identiﬁed ASD cases using records from
existing autism databases such as the US Autism and Develop
mental Disabilities Monitoring  Network the California
Department of Developmental Services  and the British
Columbia Autism Assessment Network Other studies utilized ASD
screening tools such as the AutismTics ADHD and other Comor
bidities  inventory to ascertain cases to be included in the
studies The other 2 studies used maternal reports and validated by
Autism Diagnostic Interview 
See more details on model covariates air pollutant concentration
measurement methods and ASD ascertainment methods in
Table A1 in Appendix We looked at the studies by study period
since the prevalence of ASD has risen dramatically in recent years
and there is a need to see how air pollution might be contributing
to the increased prevalence However recent studies with recent
birth cohort show that there is no association between maternal air
pollution exposure and ASD indicating that little was known about
the potential association between exposure and ASD
33
Inclusion and exclusion of studies for metaanalysis
We applied both the NOS  and Lam
et al’s navigation guide to the 25 eligible studies based on their
characteristics in Table 1 and Table A1  By inclusion
exclusion criteria we found that four air pollutants PM25 PM10
NO2 and ozone had at least 3 comparable studies with comparable
exposure time  which were required for meta
analysis We excluded 11 studies since they reported other air
pollutants  examined preconception or postnatal
period  or other reasons  as summarized in
screening tools resulted in the same quality of the 14 selected
studies for the metaanalysis The 14 studies had a median score of
8  from the NOS and high or moderate quality from the
navigation guide indicating low bias
34 Study ﬁndings from systematic review association between air
pollutants and ASD
PM25 Of the 13 studies that assessed PM25 exposure 5 found
signiﬁcant associations with ASD In 2013 Becerra et al and Volk
et al both used California DDS records for ASD cases and reported
signiﬁcant ORs 107  per 468 mgm and 208 
H Chun et al  Environmental Pollution 256  113307
per 887 mgm respectively In 2018 however 2 other studies
Goodrich et al and Kerin et al found no association even though
their study populations also consisted of Californian children In
2015 Raz et al found an increased OR of 142  per
440 mgm especially for trimester 3 based on the Nurses’ Health
Study II Furthermore in 2017 Kim et al found PM25 and total copy
number variations  a type of genomic changes that
contribute to autism susceptibility together were associated with a
higher risk of ASD than PM25 alone There is also evidence to
suggest an association between postnatal PM25 exposure and ASD
In 2018 Chen et al found that PM25 exposure in the 2nd and 3rd
year of life resulted in an OR of 150  and 178 
respectively per 34 mgm As well in 2018 Ritz et al reported that
at 9 months of age there is an OR of 104  per 361 mgm
Excluding 4 studies AlHamdan et al 2018 Kerin et al 2018 Kim
et al 2017 Chen et al 2018 due to ecological study designs
different methods of ascertaining cases and controls or longer
exposure time  we
included the remaining 9 studies for our metaanalysis Metaan
alyses with 11 studies with postnatal studies Kim et al 2017 Chen
et al 2018 were done in the sensitivity analysis later
PM10 Of the 14 studies that assessed the association between
PM10 exposure and ASD 3 studies found signiﬁcant associations In
2013 Volk et al found an increased OR of 217  per

effects of PM10 combined with the CNV led to a higher OR than
PM10 alone With regards to postnatal exposures in 2018 Chen

et al 2017 Kerin et al 2018 Chen et al 2018 due to a different
measurement  or postnatal period
NO2 Of the 12 studies that assessed maternal exposure to NO2
in relation to ASD 6 studies found signiﬁcant associations In 2013
Volk et al found signiﬁcant OR of 182  per 141 ppb for
prenatal period but Jung et al found a signiﬁcant association at
different time periods depending on ASD diagnosis during the one
year that preceded a diagnosis at relative risk of 443 
per 10 ppb In 2018 Ritz et al found NO2 exposure in all trimesters
to be associated with an increased OR of ASD reporting an OR of
110  per 1141 mgm increase in NO2 during the entire
pregnancy period Also in 2018 Kerin et al assessed the association
with various air pollutants more broadly including ASD severity
cognitive abilities and adaptive functions
In the same year
Goodrich et al assessed NO2 along with diet for mothers with high
NO2 and found a statistically signiﬁcant difference between low
and high prenatal folic acid intake On the other hand the other 7

longer exposure time than prenatal period or NOx
Ozone Out of 7 studies that assessed a link between maternal
exposure to ozone and ASD 2 found signiﬁcant associations In
2013 Becerra et al found that in a twopollutant model with ozone
and PM25 the prenatal exposure to ozone resulted in an increased
OR of 112  per 1154 ppb Jung et al also found an
increased hazard ratio of ASD for ozone exposure during the one
year prior to an ASD diagnosis However 5 studies Goodrich et al
2018 Kerin et al 2018 Kim et al 2017 Volk et al 2013 Kaufman

For PM25 PM10 NO2 and ozone Table C8 summarizes meta

trimester was in common among the 4 air pollutants
353 Sensitivity analysis 
The Funnel plots in Fig E1  overall shows little bias
of publication Fig E2 demonstrates each study’s relative contri
bution to the metaestimates for each air pollutant We found 1 to 3
studies contributed at least 20 of each pollutant two out of 9
studies  for PM25 three out of 9 studies


studies  for NO2 and one out of 4
studies  for ozone This implies the metaestimates
are overall sensitive to a few speciﬁc studies
While all studies contained casecontrol designs except 2
studies Pagalan et al  and Guxens et al  Guxens et al
used a cohort study for the prenatal period only  for PM25
PM10 and NO2 reporting the ORs for EU and 4 individual countries
We approached this study for our metaanalysis in two ways 
excluding it to include casecontrol studies only and  including it
as four individual studies meaning a total of 12 studies for PM25 12
studies for PM10 and 10 studies for NO2 Overall the metaestimates
were comparable with little difference in signiﬁcance regardless of
the Guxens study 
To focus on maternal exposure our metaanalysis excluded two
studies in Table 1 because they reported the ORs for a postnatal
period only  or a combined period with prenatal
period  but included 5 studies that reported pre
conception or postnatal periods along with prenatal period
Kalkbrenner et al 2015 Raz et al 2015 2018 Talbott et al 2015a
Volk et al 2013 We combined these studies in 3 ways as shown in
Table C10 to extend exposure time periods
 T4 preconception period only or T4þpreconception combined
 T4 postnatal period only or T4þ postnatal period combined
and
 T4 preconception period postnatal period or combined period
If one study included before  and after post
natal the prenatal period  respectively we included the study
as 3 individual studies with each exposure time Thus the number
of studies is bigger than reported in Table C9 The metaestimates of
ORs within each air pollutant are consistently higher for the period
of prenatal or postnatal combined but lower for the period of
prenatal or preconception combined Overall metaestimates of
the prenatal combined with postnatal period appeared to be higher
than the prenatal period only
4 Discussion
This systematic review summarized 25 studies that examined
the association between maternal exposure to ambient air pollut
ants and ASD in children The study ﬁndings were inconsistent and
metaanalyses were applied to pool the study results We grouped
the studyspeciﬁc ORs by air pollutant PM25 PM10 NO2 and
ozone and exposure time  and found limited evidence
for positive associations Among the four air pollutants PM25
resulted in the highest OR for the prenatal period 106
and 106 from frequentist and Bayesian random effects
model respectively The odds of ASD in children were 6 higher
through maternal exposure to PM25 However PM25 is a mixture of
various ﬁne particles and thus further investigations to examine
speciﬁc PM components linked to ASD are necessary to analyze this
difference between PM25 and the other three pollutants
Exposure time differences
in 4 predetermined periods
 and 2 more extended periods to pre
conception and postnatal period were examined under sensitivity
analysis All metaestimates were comparable implying little dif
ference regarding exposure time related to pregnancy However
there was an uncertain indication that postnatal exposures might
be more linked to the ASD than preconception which was
consistent among the 4 pollutants The trend in the trimester
speciﬁc ORs was investigated Trimester 3 was found to be more
associated with the ASD than the others The myelin sheath is a
plasma membrane extension that is laid down in regularly spaced
segments along axons of the nervous system This process involves
extensive changes in oligodendrocyte cell shape and membrane
architecture Myelination starts around 24e weeks of gestation
and reaches its peak by 1 year of age  Imaging
and biopsy of the brains of autistic children have shown a deﬁcit in
myelination as compared to normal children Aoki et al 2013
Zikopoulos and Barbas 2010 Such a diminution would weaken the
operation of the axontarget synapse thereby accounting for the
malfunction of areas of the brain involved in behavior This would
include the prefrontal and temporal areas of the brain As the
myelination process starts late second trimester it could have more
impact on the third trimester This might explain a ﬁnding of this
study that the associations between air pollution and the ASD are
likely higher for the third trimester compared to the others A

temporal
trend in associations during pregnancy cannot be
concluded due to the discrepancies between studies and the dis
agreements in signiﬁcance between metaanalysis methods sig
niﬁcance by frequentist vs insigniﬁcance by Bayesian
It is widely recognized that the etiology of ASD is complex and
related to many factors including genetic background environ
mental risk factors and geneenvironment interactions Landrigan
et al 2012 Dawson and Bernier 2013 Earlier research on the
cause of ASD focused largely on genetic changes or mutations
Autism Genome Project Consortium et al 2007 Landrigan et al
2012 Von Ehrenstein et al 2014 However it is now understood
that the perinatal period is critical for brain development Thus
exposure to environmental chemicals during this time could
disturb normal neurodevelopment
Eskenazi et al 2007
Landrigan et al 2012 Ye et al 2017 therefore providing a plau
sible link between environmental risk factors and ASD Our sys
tematic review which is updated by including more recent studies
provides similar ﬁndings to the previous studies Becerra et al
2013 Raz et al 2015 While there was some evidence indicating
maternal exposure to PM25 may increase the risk of ASD evidence
for the effect of ozone PM10 and NO2 on ASD is weak or limited An
increase in the number of studies for a future metaanalysis would
improve statistical power to identify associations between air
pollutants and ASD
41 Difference by exposure time
The ﬁve studies in practice the difference can be detected when the maternal expo
sure concentrations vary over time or when some effect modiﬁers
including behaviors  changes over time For
example the former can be explained if the mothers avoided going
outside during a speciﬁc trimester and the latter can result if they
were on medications or dietary supplements for a speciﬁc
trimester
While two air pollution studies Kalkbrenner et al 2015 Raz
et al 2015 concluded ASD associations to be speciﬁc to the third
trimester the mechanism remains largely unknown Weisskopf
et al  speculated that women working outside the home
may be more focused on prescribed rest or maternal leave in the
third trimester This workpattern change may open more time for
outside activities which in turn could affect the amount of PM
exposure However other potentially relevant studies on physical
and mental behavior changes suggest varied results often in
different trimesters with involvement of certain biological events
or personal behavior 
Attempts were made to quantify changes in leisuretime phys
ical activity  during the ﬁrst half of pregnancy compared with
the year prior to pregnancy  After
studying 1175 healthy pregnant women it was concluded that
pregnancy involved a decrease in LTPA not only in frequency but
also duration and intensity Physical activity can be further reduced
due to musculoskeletal pain in the back handwrist and hip factors
which complicate pregnancy and mobility especially in the third
trimester  As pregnancy progresses a
period of emotional and behavioral changes 
ensues This can include different nutritional choices efforts to
quit smoking and gestational weight gain  An
increase in stress can follow causing a depletion of metabolic re
sources Seebacher et al  concluded that in latestage preg
nancy the metabolic cost of activity or behavior could render
reproduction sensitive to environmental changes
It should be noted that the maternal exposures by trimester are
correlated which would reduce statistical power to detect differ
ences in ASD development of children by trimester Studies
42 Strengths of this review
Our approach for systematic review in this study is not much
different from other systematic studies on the ASD For example
search strategy and metaanalysis are comparable However we
focused on ﬁve areas including study publication time environ
mental cause of the ASD target population metaanalysis method
and timevarying associations  We examined more recent
studies published by April 2019 and thus could update study
ﬁndings  The environmental causes of the ASD are still unknown
and we focused on speciﬁc ambient air pollution  As the diag
nosis methods ASD have changed we focused in particular on
children to reduce the discrepancy in diagnosis ASD  As
mentioned in Discussion we compared three metaanalysis
methods
frequentist ﬁxed and random effects models and
Bayesian random effect model  We demonstrated inconsistent
timevarying associations over trimesters between air pollutants
and between studies We believe that this study added updated
ﬁndings in these ﬁve areas
Applying a Bayesian random effects model and its associated
rigors is the primary strength While the ﬁxed effects model con
siders sampling variation within individual studies only the
random effects model also consider betweenstudy variations thus
producing larger standard error of estimates wider interval esti
mates There are 2 approaches for the random effects model the
frequentist and Bayesian methods Typically
the frequentist
random effects model has been applied to most metaanalysis for
example recently by Lam et al  and FloresPajot et al 
A small sampling of studies often results in considerable discrep
ancies between these methods When discrepancies appear as
shown in Figs 2e the Bayesian estimates are more reliable in
integrating multiple studies on the same or comparable research
questions even though they return weaker evidence than the fre
quentist estimates In addition there is another reason to consider
the Bayesian model when there are unusually higher or lower
study estimates than the others For example Volk et al 
returned higher ORs with relatively smaller intervals compared to
the other studies The inﬂuence of this speciﬁc study on the meta
estimate is reduced by the Bayesian model This is also a preferred
feature for integrating multistudy results by reducing bias in meta
analysis
Secondly the differences in exposuretime during pregnancy for
each pollutant was evaluated The time variation pattern can differ
among pollutants While one could be more critical to the earliest
stage of pregnancy others could affect later stages of pregnancy
Previous studies centered mainly on the entire pregnancy period
and assumed the association constant with pregnancy While
FloresPajot et al  captured critical exposure windows during
pregnancy  the conclusion
was that there is a need to track residential mobility during preg
nancy to account for changes in exposure Similarly Lam et al
 highlighted the inaccuracy of exposure assessment
methods in their study limitations FloresPajot et al and Lam et al
considered misclassiﬁcations of exposures during pregnancy To
understand observed differences between trimesters this study
considered maternal changes in physical behavioral and emotional
aspects

43 Limitations of this review
Lyall et al  conﬁrm that several studies have shown sig
niﬁcant increases in ASD risk associated with particulate matter
and heavy metals However diesel exhaust chemicals from trafﬁc
related pollutants and heavy metals could not be examined since
many studies  reported the 4 air pollutants only Studies
with longterm exposure time  were
excluded since many mainly reported the prenatal period We
reviewed articles in English only and thus our metaanalysis
excluded other study results reported in nonEnglish languages
This could bring in unexpected and unmeasurable bias in our meta
estimates which is also a limitation of this review
In a scoping review for environmental factors associated with
ASD Ng et al  summarized the risk factors as trafﬁcrelated
air pollutants advanced parental age preterm birth low birth
weight hyperbilirubinemia and clustering of pregnancy compli
cations and maternal immigrant status These factors for the meta
analysis could not be considered due to limited studies Due to
these limitations this study focused on the 4 air pollutants for
prenatal period only
This study reports metaestimates of the OR based on several
casecontrol studies which is the ratio of odds of exposure among
the cases to that of the controls The OR approximates the relative
risk which estimates the magnitude of the association between
exposure to the speciﬁed ambient air pollutants and the ASD While
the OR provides relative difference between exposed and unex
posed groups another measuredattributable riskdindicates ab
solute difference in the incidence of the ASD between the two
groups It quantiﬁes the incidence of the ASD in the exposed group
that could be reduced if not exposed However this study cannot
provide the attributable risk since the incidence could not be
determined from the casecontrol studies examined in this study
With the small barely signiﬁcant ORs  we
expect the contribution of the speciﬁed pollutants to the overall
prevalence of ASD is quite small
5 Conclusion
Our metaanalysis on the association between maternal expo
sure to ambient air pollution during the prenatal period and ASD in
children has produced some evidence for PM25 weak evidence for
NO2 little evidence for PM10 and inconclusive evidence for ozone
 The timevarying effects of
maternal exposure over the 3 trimesters were inconsistent and our
metaanalysis returned insigniﬁcant changes over
trimester
However the noticeable difference in the trimesters among studies
merits further investigation
