Abstract
We systematically reviewed evidence from observational studies on the associations between autism spectrum disorders 
(ASD) and early-life antibiotic exposure. Eleven articles were included in the review. Prenatal antibiotic exposure was associ-
ated with a slightly increased risk of ASD in two cohort studies on overlapping populations and in one case–control study; 
in three other case–control studies, no significant association was found. One cohort study found a slightly reduced risk of 
ASD after postnatal antibiotic exposure, while two other cohort studies on overlapping populations and three case–control 
studies reported an increased risk. Meta-analysis of the eligible studies showed no significant associations. Current data are 
conflicting and do not conclusively support the hypothesis that early-life antibiotic exposure is associated with subsequent 
ASD development.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of neurode-
velopmental conditions characterized by persistent deficits 
in social communication and restricted, repetitive pat-
terns of behavior, interests, or activities, beginning in the 
developmental period (American Psychiatric Association 
2013). Currently used term ‘ASD’ is an umbrella diag-
nosis for a group of conditions, namely: autistic disorder, 
Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and 
pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified 
(PDD-NOS). The World Health Organization estimates 
that approximately one in 160 children has ASD (World 
Health Organization 2017). However, according to recent

studies, the current prevalence of ASD in certain commu-
nities may fall between 1 and 2% (Christensen et al. 2016; 
Brugha et al. 2011). Moreover, the prevalence of autism has 
steadily risen during the last decades (Lai et al. 2014). The 
etiology of ASD is heterogeneous (Howes et al. 2018). Mul-
tiple genetic factors (Miles 2011), a variety of environmental 
factors (Hertz-Picciotto et al. 2018), and a complex inter-
play between these factors (Chaste and Leboyer 2012) have 
been proposed and extensively studied. A recent rise in the 
prevalence of ASD suggests a major role of the environment. 
Since the symptoms of ASD typically occur during early 
childhood, potential causative factors are most likely to act 
during the prenatal and early postnatal periods.
One of the investigated risk factors for ASD is exposure 
to antibiotics during pregnancy and childhood. It has been 
suggested that the intestinal microbiota affects brain func-
tion and human behavior, through the so-called microbi-
ome-gut-brain axis (Cryan and Dinan 2012). Antibiotics 
are one of the factors known to disturb the composition of 
the microbiota in infancy (Yassour et al. 2016). Addition-
ally, a number of studies have confirmed that individuals 
with ASD have different intestinal microbiome compositions 
compared to those of healthy individuals (Kraneveld et al. 
2016). In regard to potential effects of antibiotics on ASD, 
improvement of ASD symptoms after antibiotic use was 
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2019) 49:3866–3876 
reported in two case studies (Sandler et al. 2000; Rodakis 
2015). However, high use of different antibiotics in children 
who subsequently developed autism was shown in a num-
ber of observational studies (Fallon 2005; Niehus and Lord 
2006; Bittker and Bell 2018). Hypothetically, these observed 
effects could be attributable to microbiota alterations, trig-
gering a disturbed immune response and the release of 
cytokines, thus, affecting the function of the central nerv-
ous system (de Theije et al. 2011). Recently, a number of 
observational studies have assessed a possible association of 
early-life antibiotic exposure and subsequent development 
of ASD. Here we aimed to systematically document avail-
able evidence on the association between early life antibiotic 
exposure and the prevalence of ASD later in in childhood.
Methods
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria for the Review
Cohort studies, case–control studies, and cross-sectional 
studies  were  eligible  for  inclusion  in  this  review.  The 
included  studies  needed  to  investigate  an  association 
between pre- and/or postnatal antibiotic exposure and sub-
sequent diagnosis of ASD. We included studies in which 
women during any trimester of pregnancy or infants and/
or children underwent antibiotic treatment. We focused on 
early-life antibiotic exposure that preceded a diagnosis of 
ASD, which is usually established after the second year of 
life (Mandell et al. 2005). Studies on antibiotic exposure in 
breastfeeding mothers and subsequent risk of ASD in their 
children were not included. Since the hypothesized link 
between ASD and antibiotic use is based on the aforemen-
tioned microbiome-gut-brain axis mechanism, only stud-
ies which reported data on systemic and/or oral antibiotic 
therapy were taken into an account. Any antibiotic types 
and doses, as well as any treatment durations and indica-
tions were admissible, as long as the therapy fulfilled the 
aforementioned criteria. Studies that reported data on anti-
biotic use collectively (e.g., along with other medications) 
or that did not report numerical data were excluded. Studies 
in which the data on antibiotic use was collected only for the 
purpose of baseline characteristic of participants, with no 
analysis of the association between antibiotic use and ASD 
were also excluded.
Our outcome of interest was the diagnosis of ASD during 
childhood. Studies in which the diagnosis was made accord-
ing to established criteria, such as those described in the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V 
(American Psychiatric Association 2013), as well as stud-
ies in which ASD was reported by parents, caregivers or 
doctors without any described specific criteria, were avail-
able for inclusion. Studies that reported data on ASD only 
collectively with other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., 
together with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), were 
excluded. Only studies that compared children with ASD up 
to 18 years of age to generally healthy children without this 
diagnosis were included.
Search Methods
A systematic literature search was performed on 28th of 
August 2018, with no language or publication date restric-
tions. The databases searched were PubMed, Embase, and 
PsycINFO. After drafting the first version of the manuscript, 
we ran a search update on the 11th of December 2018. The 
full search strategies for PubMed and Embase are presented 
in Online Resource 1. Additionally, reference lists of identi-
fied observational studies and relevant review articles were 
manually screened.
Study Selection
Three authors/reviewers (AH, BPG, JŁ) independently 
screened the title of each study identified with the search 
strategy as well as the abstracts of potentially relevant arti-
cles. Subsequently, the full text for each study potentially 
relevant after abstract screening, as well as that for studies of 
unclear relevance, was retrieved. Each author independently 
assessed the eligibility of the articles and, in cases of a disa-
greement, resolved differences by discussion.
Data Extraction and Risk of Bias Assessment
Data were extracted with the use of a standard data extrac-
tion form. The extracted data included study year, country, 
design, population, definition of exposure, definitions of 
cases and controls (for case–control studies), definition of 
outcome (for cohort studies), results, confounding factors, 
and data collection methods. We extracted and reported all 
the data using the same terminology as the authors of the 
original articles.
Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa 
Scale (NOS) (Wells et al. 2011), in which the reviewers 
assign stars in all predefined bias domains. In the com-
parability domain the reviewers have to assign 0, 1, or 2 
stars on the basis of the number and types of confounding 
factors controlled for. Multiple important confounding fac-
tors may play a role in studies on the antibiotic-ASD asso-
ciation, including those related to different demographics, 
pregnancy-related complications, mothers’ obstetrical histo-
ries, child characteristics at birth, infections, environmental 
exposures, and healthcare use (Lyall et al. 2017). The NOS 
requires the reviewers to assign stars depending on two cho-
sen, most important factors. After the literature search and 
discussion, we found no rationale to decide whether any of 
3867
3868
 
the above-mentioned factors was more important than the 
others. Therefore, we decided to assign zero stars to stud-
ies in which no confounding factors were controlled for or 
the adjustment was unclear, and two stars to studies which 
controlled for any confounding factors. Additionally, for 
informative purposes, we present confounders identified in 
each study in a separate table. We decided to present risk 
of bias only descriptively and no collective score for the 
included studies was counted.
Data Analysis
A meta-analysis of the findings was performed if at least two 
studies of the same type (cohort, case–control) reported the 
adjusted odds ratios (aOR) or adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) 
of ASD being diagnosed in participants exposed to antibi-
otics during the same life period (pre- or postnatally). We 
performed the meta-analyses using the Review Manager 5.3 
software by the Cochrane Collaboration. Generic inverse 
variance with the random effects model was used. Addition-
ally, the fixed effects model was applied to see how it would 
influence the results. To enable a graphic presentation of the 
findings in studies which didn’t report OR or HR, we calcu-
lated crude ORs/HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) 
of ASD being diagnosed after antibiotic exposure, provided 
the data were sufficient.

Results
Overall Characteristics
In total, we identified 6820 records by the database search 
and 891 records by reference screening. After exclusion 
of duplicates and title and abstract screening, the full 
texts of 63 articles were assessed for eligibility. Thirty-
seven observational studies on risk factors for autism were 
excluded because they did not report antibiotic exposure. 
Reasons for exclusion of the remaining 15 studies are 
listed in Online Resource 2. After full-text assessment, 
11 articles ultimately met the inclusion criteria for this 
review. The flow diagram of the selection process is pre-
sented in Fig. 1.
Online Resources 3 and 4 present characteristics and 
main results of the included studies. Four of those studies 
were cohort studies, and seven of them were case–con-
trol studies. Among the included cohort studies, three 
Danish studies (Atladottir et al. 2012; Wimberley et al. 
2018; Axelsson et al. 2019) were performed in overlap-
ping populations. Five studies examined prenatal antibiotic 
exposure, five assessed early childhood antibiotic exposure 
and 1 study examined both types of exposure (Wimberley 
et al. 2018). In the majority of included studies, use of any 
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2019) 49:3866–3876 
antibiotic, for any indication and duration and at any dose 
within the defined time period, was analyzed. Addition-
ally, all of the cohort studies and two of the case–control 
studies included a number of secondary/sensitivity analy-
ses, taking antibiotic type, spectrum, timing, number of 
courses, and/or indication into account.
Overall, three out of four included cohort studies earned a 
maximum number of stars, and only one study lost one star 
in one of the NOS domains. In contrast, all of the case–con-
trol studies carried a considerable amount of bias, mostly 
concerning case definitions, control for confounding factors, 
and ascertainment of exposure. Details of risk of bias assess-
ment for cohort and case–control studies, respectively, are 
presented in Online Resource 5. Additionally, we listed all 
the confounding factors used in adjusted analyses in Online 
Resource 6.
Prenatal Antibiotic Exposure
Cohort Studies
Prenatal antibiotic exposure as a risk factor for autism was 
examined in two large Danish cohort studies performed 
in overlapping populations. The studies involved, respec-
tively: 96,736 children, including 976 with ASD (Atladot-
tir et al. 2012) and 780,547 children, including 9352 with 
autism (Wimberley et al. 2018). Population of the first study 
was most likely contained within the population of the sec-
ond, therefore, we didn’t perform a meta-analysis. The first 
study reported a borderline significant increase in the risk 
of ASD after use of any antibiotics anytime during preg-
nancy (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.2; 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.0–1.4). A stronger association of prenatal 
antibiotic exposure with the risk of ASD was reported for 
the use of sulfonamides anytime during pregnancy (aHR 
1.5; 95% CI 1.0–2.2) and use of penicillins during the sec-
ond (aHR 1.4; CI 1.1–1.8) and third (aHR 1.4; CI 1.0–1.8) 
trimester. Similar results were observed for infantile autism 
(defined as ICD-10 code F84.0 assigned to participant), with 
the strongest association reported for the use of macrolides 
anytime during the pregnancy (aHR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1–4.4). 
Confounding factors controlled for in adjusted model were

as follows: gender, maternal age, parity, maternal smoking 
during pregnancy, paternal age, parental psychiatric history, 
and parents’ educational status.
The second study reported a significant, positive asso-
ciation between exposure to any antibiotic anytime during 
pregnancy and subsequent risk of autism in the offspring 
(aHR 1.18; 95% CI 1.13–1.23). The analysis was adjusted 
only for sex and age. Assessment of this association was not 
a primary focus of the study, and it was only reported as a 
secondary analysis in the supplementary materials.
Case–Control Studies
Four of the included case–control studies examined risk of 
ASD after prenatal antibiotic exposure. Among them, two 
clinic-based studies (George et al. 2014; Guisso et al. 2018), 
were available for a meta-analysis. They were conducted in 
groups of children of 343 (143 with autism) and 314 (136 
with ASD), respectively. None of those studies found sig-
nificant associations between antibiotic use and ASD, with 
pooled odds ratio from random effect model of 1.24; 95% 
CI 0.53–2.92 (Fig. 2). In the first study, confounding fac-
tors used for the analysis were not described (George et al. 
2014), while the second study controlled for a number of 
perinatal, gestational, and socioeconomic variables (Guisso 
et al. 2018).
In one study conducted in 288 Polish children includ-
ing 96 with autism (Mrozek-Budzyn et al. 2013), the results 
were presented as the percent of cases versus percent of con-
trols exposed to prenatal antibiotics. The univariate model 
revealed significantly higher exposure to antibiotics in the 
autism group (17% vs. 2%, p < 0.001). However, for unde-
scribed reasons, the antibiotics were analyzed only collec-
tively with other medications in the multivariate model.
The last study was performed in 415 Swedish children, 
including 206 with ASD (Isaksson et al. 2017). In the sta-
tistical model, autism was regressed on antibiotic use dur-
ing pregnancy. The data were presented as logistic regres-
sion betas in the form of log odds (β = − 0.15, standard 
error = 0.45, p > 0.05 in regular regression; β = 1.78, stand-
ard error = 1.04, p > 0.05 in fixed effects regression) and 
were reported by the authors as not statistically significant.

None of the aforementioned case–control studies investi-
gated type of antibiotic, duration of antibiotic therapy, or its 
timing during pregnancy. All ORs and HRs for ASD after 
use of prenatal antibiotics versus non-exposed group are pre-
sented graphically in Fig. 3.
Early Childhood Antibiotic Exposure
Cohort Studies
Early childhood antibiotic exposure as a risk factor for 
autism was examined in three cohort studies. One study 
performed in 214,834 Canadian children, including 2965 
with ASD (Hamad et al. 2018), reported a trend towards a 
reduced risk of ASD in children exposed to any antibiot-
ics during the first year of life after adjusting for relevant 
demographic, prenatal, perinatal, and postnatal factors (aHR 
0.91; 95% CI 0.84–0.99). Stratifying the analysis by sex and 
region resulted in a statistically significant association in 
males (aHR 0.91; 95% CI 0.83–1.00) and in children from 
urban regions (aHR 0.85; 95% CI 0.77–0.94). In secondary 
analyses, a borderline significance was found for the associa-
tion of specific antibiotic groups with ASD, namely peni-
cillin (aHR 0.92; 95% CI 0.84–1.00) and macrolides (aHR 
0.87; 95% CI 0.77–0.99). The number of antibiotic courses 
and duration of therapy were not associated with ASD risk. 
In additional analysis of sibling-controlled design, antibiot-
ics use was not associated with risk of developing ASD.

Two other cohort studies were nation-wide, register-
based studies of the Danish population. Both of these stud-
ies derived data from the same registers and covered similar 
time periods, so their populations largely overlapped. In 
one study in 677,403 children, including 8267 with autism 
(Axelsson et al. 2019), a slightly increased risk of autism 
was observed in children exposed postnatally to penicillin 
(aHR 1.11, 95% CI 1.04–1.19) as well as to broader-spec-
trum antibiotics (aHR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04–1.16) compared 
to children unexposed to antibiotics in the standard model. 
However, a significant association was no longer observed 
in the between-within sibling model (aHR 1.05, 95% CI 
0.93–1.18 and aHR 1.05, 95% CI 0.95–1.16 for penicillin 
and broader-spectrum antibiotics, respectively). In another 
study performed in 780,547 children including 9352 with 
autism (Wimberley et al. 2018), the risk of autism increased 
after broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure before the age of 
5 (aHR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09–1.42). Moreover, risk of autism 
was higher after exposure to broad-spectrum and moder-
ate-spectrum antibiotics anytime during childhood (aHR 
1.51, 95% CI 1.33–1.72 and aHR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13–1.32, 
respectively). Both of these studies controlled for a range 
of potential confounders, including different demographic, 
pregnancy and neonatal factors, parental psychiatric history, 
and parity.
Since at least two studies of the same type reported the 
aHR of ASD after antibiotic exposure, a meta-analysis was 
feasible. However, the two Danish studies were performed in 
highly overlapping populations, so pooling of their data was 
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2019) 49:3866–3876 
not justifiable. To perform a meta-analysis, we used the data 
from the 1 of the 2 Danish studies, in which the exposure 
and its timing were consistent with those in the Canadian 
study (Hamad et al. 2018). Pooling of the data did not yield 
any significant association between antibiotic exposure and 
subsequent diagnosis of ASD, either in the standard model 
(summary effect estimate 1.00, 95% CI 0.83–1.21) or in 
the sibling model (summary effect estimate 1.05, 95% CI 
0.96–1.14), both in random effects (Figs. 4, 5) and fixed 
effects analysis.
Case–Control Studies
Three case–control studies examined association between 
ASD and childhood antibiotic exposure. One internet sur-
vey-based study performed in 1515 children (1001 with 
ASD) (Bittker and Bell 2018), which reported the data in 
the form of logistic regression OR, found a positive associa-
tion between the number of antibiotic courses taken during 
the first 2 years of life and subsequent diagnosis of ASD in 
all performed analyses, including the final multifactor model 
(aOR 1.083; 95% CI 1.023–1.151). The study controlled for 
age of the child, ethnicity, maternal education, and region.
Another study performed in a group of 214 children (73 
with autism) (Grossi et al. 2018) reported crude ORs of 
autism in children exposed postnatally to antibiotics com-
pared to unexposed unrelated controls (OR 2.43; 95% CI 
0.9–6.52) and unexposed healthy siblings (OR 2.03; 95% 
CI 0.40–9.1). Additionally, a multivariable modeling of data 
was performed with use of the Auto-CM artificial neural net-
work—a method that does not generate numerical results but 
Fig. 4   Meta-analysis of cohort studies on postnatal antibiotic exposure—standard model
Fig. 5   Meta-analysis of cohort studies on postnatal antibiotic exposure—sibling model
rather provides a map of associations of strength between all 
variables in the data set. According to the authors’ interpre-
tation, the proximity of ‘early antibiotic use’ to the ‘autism 
node’ observed on the map may suggest a significant asso-
ciation between the two.
In one case–control study involving 99 children (75 with 
autism/ASD) (Niehus and Lord 2006), the mean number of 
antibiotic courses taken before the age of 2 years was sig-
nificantly higher in the autism/ASD group compared to the 
control group (6.88 vs. 3.48, p < 0.01). Data provided by the 
authors were insufficient to calculate ORs.
None of these case–control studies assessed specific types 
of antibiotics nor the duration of therapy within the analyses. 
ORs and HRs of ASD in exposed versus unexposed groups 
for these studies are presented on Fig. 6.
Discussion
In this review on pre- and postnatal antibiotic exposure and 
subsequent risk of autism/ASD, a total of 11 observational 
studies were included. In two identified cohort studies on 
prenatal antibiotic exposure performed in overlapping pop-
ulations, a slightly increased risk of ASD/infantile autism 
after the use of various antibiotics was observed. However, 
3 of 4 identified case–control studies did not report any sig-
nificant association between prenatal antibiotic exposure 
and autism risk, whereas one reported a positive association 
based only on univariate analysis. Three identified cohort 
studies on early childhood antibiotic exposure reported con-
flicting evidence. In one cohort study, a small trend towards

a reduced risk of ASD in infants exposed to various antibi-
otics in their first year of life was observed, which was not 
significant in secondary analyses based on sibling-controlled 
design. In another cohort study, a borderline increased 
risk of ASD was observed with exposure to certain types 
of antibiotics in a standard model but no association was 
observed in a between-within sibling model. Finally, in the 
third study on a cohort overlapping with the previous one, a 
significantly higher risk of autism after exposure to various 
classes of antibiotics was observed. Data from case–control 
studies on antibiotic exposure during childhood were more 
consistent. All three of them reported significant, positive 
associations between antibiotic use and later ASD diagnosis.
To our knowledge, no previous systematic review has 
examined antibiotic use during pregnancy and early child-
hood as a potential risk factor for ASD. A number of meta-
analyses have reported data on various infections preced-
ing ASD diagnosis (Modabbernia et al. 2017), and some 
have found significant positive associations with infections 
occurring during pregnancy (Jiang et al. 2016; Gardener 
et al. 2009). Additionally, one of those systematic reviews 
reported increased risk of ASD after prenatal exposure to 
different medications, including antibiotics, which were, 
however, not assessed separately (Gardener et al. 2009). In 
another meta-analysis, no associations between early post-
natal infections and subsequent risk of ASD were found 
(Gardener et al. 2011). On the other hand, some observa-
tional studies have found evidence of a higher risk of mental 
disorders after various infections in older children and in 
adults (Benros et al. 2011; Kohler et al. 2017). Recently, 
more scientific attention is being drawn towards effects of 
early-life antibiotic exposure on long-term health outcomes, 
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2019) 49:3866–3876
including reports of its negative influence on neurocognitive 
development (Slykerman et al. 2019) and risk of obesity 
(Miller et al. 2018).
The main strength of this review is its novelty, as no 
previous systematic review has focused on the association 
between early-life antibiotic exposure and ASD. Our study 
utilized a broad search strategy, complemented by an exten-
sive reference hand search, so the possibility of missing 
important published data is low. A relatively narrow clini-
cal question allowed us to focus in detail on the included 
studies and enabled a clear and meticulous presentation of 
findings. However, this review also has considerable limita-
tions. Compared to the number of other potential environ-
mental risk factors for ASD, antibiotic exposure turned out 
to be rarely assessed (Wang et al. 2017; Modabbernia et al. 
2017). Thus, only 11 studies were finally included in the 
review, the majority of which were of case–control design. 
After division into groups depending on study type and tim-
ing of exposure, small groups of 2 to 4 studies were created. 
Methods of data reporting in these studies were heterogene-
ous, further limiting the capacity to perform either qualita-
tive or quantitative synthesis of the data. Moreover, each 
of the included case–control studies was characterized by a 
significant potential risk of bias. Another limitation of this 
study is the inclusion of only published data, creating a risk 
of publication bias. Finally, we excluded a number of studies 
in which infections were explored as potential risk factors 
for ASD. Some types of these infections are almost always 
treated with antibiotics (e.g., urinary tract infections dur-
ing pregnancy, severe infections in newborns), so we could 
have assumed them to be a proxy for antibiotic exposure. 
However, we decided to use only direct data on exposure.
Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders (2019) 49:3866–3876 
Results of the included studies do not provide conclusive 
evidence to support the hypothesis that prenatal antibiotic 
exposure is associated with ASD. Although a number of 
positive associations was reported in two large cohorts (Atl-
adottir et al. 2012; Wimberley et al. 2018), their popula-
tions were largely overlapping, so they cannot be treated as 
independent studies for the purpose of this review. Moreo-
ver, authors of the study with borderline significant results 
(Atladottir et al. 2012) emphasize, that within their analysis 
they made 106 comparisons with no adjustments for multi-
ple testing, so this borderline significant association between 
prenatal antibiotic exposure and ASD could have been a 
chance finding. While this study was specifically designed 
to examine prenatal risk factors of autism and tested for a 
wide range of potential confounders, the other one focused 
on postnatal factors and hardly performed any adjustment 
in the prenatal exposure analysis. Because of that, in our 
opinion the results of the former study are more meaningful.
On the other hand, all of the case–control studies reported 
no association between prenatal antibiotic exposure and 
ASD, except for one that reported higher risk of autism in 
exposed patients (Mrozek-Budzyn et al. 2013). However, 
this study was performed in a relatively small group of chil-
dren, and strangely, its finding concerning antibiotic expo-
sure was not explored in a multivariate analysis. Moreover, 
compared to the literature (Santos et al. 2010; de Jonge 
et al. 2014) an unexpectedly low percentage of women in 
the control group (2.1%) was reported to have used antibiot-
ics during pregnancy, which may suggest a bias within the 
exposure data.
Results of studies on postnatal antibiotic exposure are 
conflicting. One cohort study reported a reduced risk of 
ASD in children after antibiotic use (Hamad et al. 2018). 
However, since the main model was based only on data from 
administrative databases, the authors performed second-
ary analyses based on a sibling-controlled design. In those 
analyses, antibiotic use was not associated with the risk of 
developing ASD, hence, the authors concluded that the mar-
ginal association observed in the main model was unlikely 
to be meaningful. In another cohort study (Axelsson et al. 
2019), the between-within sibling design analysis did not 
confirm the findings from the standard design analysis of 
higher ASD risk after use of certain types of antibiotics. We 
used data from these two studies to perform a meta-analysis, 
and its results revealed no significant association. The final 
included cohort study (Wimberley et al. 2018) reported a 
positive association between postnatal antibiotic exposure 
and autism risk. However, since its population largely over-
lapped with that of the previous cohort, the two cannot be 
treated as independent studies for the purpose of this sys-
tematic review. Besides the lack of a sibling analysis in the 
latter cohort, the difference in results might have originated 
from the differences in the exposure assessment. The authors 
of the latter study defined ‘antibiotic use preceding the diag-
nosis of autism’ as the antibiotic received before the first 
diagnosis of autism registered in the national healthcare 
databases. Median age for the first autism diagnosis in this 
study was 7.1 years, which is much later than both median 
age of ASD diagnosis reported in the literature and median 
age of first developmental concerns in ASD children (Baio 
et al. 2018). Therefore, even for the subgroup of children 
exposed to antibiotics before fifth birthday it is unclear, if the 
symptoms of autism were absent before the first antibiotic 
administration. In our opinion, this might have introduced 
considerable bias.
All of the remaining case–control studies reported a posi-
tive association between postnatal antibiotic exposure and 
ASD. All of these studies were characterized by consider-
able potential sources of bias, including small sample sizes 
(Grossi et al. 2018; Niehus and Lord 2006), self-selection 
bias (Niehus and Lord 2006; Bittker and Bell 2018) reflect-
ing differences between those who choose to participate in 
a study and those who do not, potentially biased control 
group selection (Grossi et al. 2018; Niehus and Lord 2006), 
and/or lack of verification if the ASD diagnosis in the case 
group was made by a professional (Bittker and Bell 2018). 
Also, in all of these studies, the exposure data were based 
on parental reports, so a risk of recall bias (Coughlin 1990), 
especially over-reporting the exposure in ASD groups and 
under-reporting in control groups, cannot be ruled out.
Data on specific antibiotic types and risk of ASD are also 
inconsistent. In one study, an increased risk of ASD was 
reported after prenatal exposure to sulfonamides, penicil-
lins and macrolides, but not cephalosporins (Atladottir et al. 
2012). This is consistent with the evidence that macrolides 
induce distinctive changes in the microbiome composition of 
children (Korpela et al. 2016). On the other hand, expected 
microbiota alterations after the use of cephalosporins should 
be at least as strong as those after use of penicillins, due to 
cephalosporins’ broader spectrum (Biedermann and Rogler 
2015). Accordingly, another study reported a stronger asso-
ciation between ASD and both pre- and postnatal exposure 
to broad spectrum antibiotics (cephalosporins, tetracycline, 
trimethoprim-sulfonamide combination, aminoglycosides, 
and quinolones) compared to moderate-spectrum antibiot-
ics (Wimberley et al. 2018). However, no significant asso-
ciations were found between autism risk and exposure to 
narrow-spectrum antibiotics, including macrolides. In two 
other cohort studies, no significant associations between 
ASD and individual types of antibiotics were described 
(Axelsson et al. 2019; Hamad et al. 2018). Individual anti-
biotic types were analyzed and reported differently in each 
of the studies included in our systematic review; therefore, 
a meta-analysis was not possible. According to the avail-
able evidence, some patterns of microbiota composition in 
individuals with ASD have been identified, mostly regarding 
3873
3874
 
the abundance of different Clostridia and Bacteroidetes spe-
cies and an altered Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio (Rosenfeld 
2015). Such changes may be induced both by macrolides 
and broad-spectrum antibiotics (Korpela et al. 2016). On 
the other hand, microbiota alterations in different individuals 
might not follow a specific pattern even after use of the same 
antibiotic (Yassour et al. 2016). Apart from the disturbance 
of the microbiome-gut-brain axis, to our knowledge no well-
documented alternative explanations for the antibiotic-ASD 
association have been proposed.
A question concerning all of the included studies is the 
difficulty in differentiating whether the observed effects 
were due to the antibiotics themselves or were due to the 
antibiotics acting as a proxy or mediator of an underlying 
infection. Only two of the included studies controlled for 
infections occurring during the same period as antibiotic 
exposure (Hamad et al. 2018; Guisso et al. 2018). None 
of the included studies investigated differences in risk of 
autism resulting from specific indications for antibiotic ther-
apy. Three included studies reported a higher risk of autism 
after maternal respiratory infections (Atladottir et al. 2012; 
George et al. 2014), fever episodes and influenza (Atladottir 
et al. 2012), or “infections” in general (Guisso et al. 2018); 
two studies found significant positive associations between 
early childhood otitis media episodes and autism (Wimber-
ley et al. 2018; Niehus and Lord 2006). Such associations 
of prenatal and early-life infections with autism have been 
documented before (Jiang et al. 2016; Atladottir et al. 2010), 
and they may also be supported by underlying biological 
mechanisms (Singh 2009; Ponzio et al. 2007; Rosenhall 
et al. 1999).
All of the included studies in which the assessment of 
exposure was based on parental reports collected after diag-
nosis of ASD have the possibility of recall bias. Knowledge 
of a variety of potential exposures that are considered as 
risk factors for ASD is common among parents of children 
with ASD (Chaidez et al. 2018); thus, they may tend to ana-
lyze the previous medical history of their children more and 
report medication use more often than parents of the control 
children. This is a similar effect to the one observed after 
past claims of the supposed vaccination-autism association 
(Andrews et al. 2002). This may suggest a greater reliability 
of antibiotic exposure data collected prospectively or derived 
from medical records.
Yet another problem in the interpretation of possible 
antibiotic-ASD associations is the fact that, despite stable 
antibiotic use in Europe and USA in recent years (Euro-
pean Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 2018; Klein 
et al. 2018), the prevalence of ASD is actually rising in these 
regions (Lyall et al. 2017). Nevertheless, given the hetero-
geneous etiology of autism, it is difficult to exclude the pos-
sibility that reduced antibiotic use is outweighed by other 
environmental factors contributing to ASD risk.

Conclusions
Currently available data from observational studies do 
not conclusively support the hypothesis that prenatal or 
postnatal exposure to antibiotics as a group is a risk fac-
tor for ASD. However, a portion of the results from large 
cohort studies may suggest a possible trend towards higher 
risk of ASD after use of certain types of antibiotics. More 
studies, most preferably of a prospective cohort design, 
controlling adequately for potential confounding factors 
including infections, are needed to verify this association.
