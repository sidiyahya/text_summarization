Association between pesticide exposure
and paraoxonase-1 (PON1) polymorphisms,
and neurobehavioural outcomes in
children: a systematic review
Nkosinathi Banhela1*, Pragalathan Naidoo2 and Saloshni Naidoo1
Abstract
Environmental factors such as pollution, pesticide exposure and socio-demographic location have been implicated
as a pressure capable of altering genetic make-up. Altered genetic sequence of genes encoding enzymes may
result in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Of peculiar interest is the genetic variance on the paraoxonase-1
gene induced by pre- and postnatal exposure to pesticides. SNP have been reported on the paraoxonase-1 gene
and post-xenobiotic exposure and are presumed to alter gene sequence and ultimately enzymatic activity. The
altered enzymatic activity may facilitate neurodevelopment disorders. Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are among the neurodevelopment disorders of which prevalence is
concurrently associated with increasing environmental xenobiotic exposure. The variance on xenobiotic
metabolising genes is associated with altered neurodevelopment outcome and ultimately altered neurobehavioural
outcome. Prime interests of this systematic review were to establish an understanding of the sequences on the
paraoxonase-1 gene associated with adverse neurobehavioural outcome. An in-depth literature search was
conducted using the term combination “pesticide exposure, pre- and postnatal exposure, organophosphates/
organophosphorus, single nucleotide polymorphism, paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), neurodevelopment/neurobehavioural
outcome in child/infant”. Articles published from the year 2000 to 2018 were considered for review. The result
showed that variance on the PON1-108 and 192 alleles could be implicated in the development of altered
neurobehavioural outcomes.

Background
Organophosphates (OP) are a group of insecticide pesti-
cides which includes chlorpyrifos, parathion, diazinon
and fenthion. Organophosphates mode of action is by
inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase enzyme, preventing the
breakdown and uptake of acetylcholine [1]. This then leads
to an accumulation of acetylcholine and sustained excita-
tion of neurons, which ends up killing the insect. In
humans, however, the health outcome post exposure can
be acute or chronic depending on the duration of exposure.
The sustained excitation of neurons in humans may result
in symptoms such as salivation, nausea, vomiting, lacrima-
tion and seizures [1]. Whilst chronic exposure to organo-
phosphates may induce adverse respiratory [2], neurotoxic
[1, 3] and neurodevelopmental outcomes [4, 5].
Globally, there is a significant prevalence of neurodeve-
lopmental disorders in children such as autism spectrum
disorders (ASD), epilepsy and attention deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder (ADHD) [6–8]. Requena et al. reported the
prevalence of epilepsy to be significantly associated with
high pesticide use, among the South-East Spain popula-
tion [9]. In 2015, Baxter et al. performed a systematic
review on the global burden of ASD and reported a point
prevalence of 7.6 cases per 1000 population in 2010 [8].
Kogan et al. reported an ASD prevalence of 2.5% among
3–17 years age groups in the USA for 2010 [10]. In a sys-
tematic review focusing on the prevalence of neurodeve-
lopmental disorders in low- and middle-income countries,
for every 1000 population, the median pooled prevalence
for any neurodevelopment disorders (NDD) was 7.6 (95%
CI 7.5–7.7), with 11.3 (95% CI 11.7–12.0) for neurological
disorders and 3.2 (95% CI 3.1–3.3) for mental conditions
such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Sociodemographic factors [11], genetics [12], adverse ges-
tational outcomes [13] and environmental toxicants [12]
have been implicated in the aetiology of neurodevelopmen-
tal disorders. The detrimental
impact of environmental
toxicants such as pesticides on child neurodevelopment has
been widely reported [14–16].
In several developing countries, pesticides are being used
extensively in agriculture and in vector control [17]. In
Southern Africa, pyrethroids and dichlorodiphenyltrichlo-
roethane (DDT) are being extensively used to control the
growth of the Anopheles mosquito which is responsible for
malaria transmission in multiple countries [17, 18]. Fur-
thermore, there is an unregulated use of pesticides in
small-scale agricultural farming in most African countries
[17, 18]. The continuous and unregulated use of pesticides
results in persistence of pesticides in soil and water and
consequently in human and animal bodies [19]. This in-
creases exposure among individuals living in agricultural
and malaria endemic settings [20, 21].
Pesticides have been known to induce a selective pres-
sure, capable of altering single nucleotide sequences on
genes. Organophosphates are metabolised by the en-
zymes paraoxonases (POase) and arylesterases (ARYase)
which are encoded by the paraoxonase-1 (PON1) gene
[18, 19]. Paraoxinase-1 is an A-esterase enzyme found in
the liver and plasma, facilitating the breakdown of oxons
of OP (paraoxon) [4]. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP) within xenobiotic (pesticide) metabolising genes
can negatively influence the biotransformation and de-
toxification of pesticides [22]. Polymorphic status of the
PON1 gene for an individual may be involved in the de-
termination of OP susceptibility among exposed individ-
uals and may determine health outcome [3–5, 21, 23].
Two polymorphisms have been identified on the coding
region of PON1 which are Q192R and L55M and five
identified on the promoter region, which are -108(C/T),
-126(G/C), -162(A/G), -832 (G/A) and -909(C/G) [4].
Polymorphisms on the PON1 gene can negatively alter
the metabolising ability of the POase and ARYase en-
zymes [3].
Developmental neurotoxicity induced by exposure to
pesticides is a public health concern because of its asso-
ciated damaging effects on the central nervous system
(CNS), resulting in a decline in cognitive ability [24].
SNP on the PON1 gene can negatively impact neurode-
velopment, as acetylcholine is a potent neurotransmitter
for the development and functioning of the CNS [21,
25]. Maternal exposure to pesticides during pregnancy
can negatively impact the growth and development of
the foetus in utero, leading to adverse birth outcomes
[7] and neurodevelopment [16] as the neonates progress
in age.
Genetic variability on the PON1 gene induced by expos-
ure to OP has been reported [4, 23]; however, distinctive
associations with neurobehavioural health outcomes in
children are still due [3, 5, 21].
Thus, the aim of this systematic literature review was to
gather information on the associations between pesticide
exposure (organophosphates), single nucleotide polymor-
phisms in the PON1 gene, and further associate with neu-
robehavioural health outcomes in children.
Methods
This systematic review gathered relevant information
from the literature about pesticide exposure in pregnant
women, single nucleotide polymorphisms in the PON1
gene and neurobehavioural health outcomes in their off-
spring. A narrative approach was undertaken to review
available data for this study.
Search strategy
Articles considered for the review were published be-
tween the years 2000 and 2018. Articles were retrieved
using online search engines and library sources, includ-
ing the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Web of
Page 2 of 12
Banhela et al. Systematic Reviews           (2020) 9:109 
Knowledge, Cochrane library, Google, Google Scholar,
PubMed Search and Science Direct. The key terms used
to generate the search were “pesticide exposure” and “pre-
natal exposure”,
“organophosphates/organophosphorus”
and “single nucleotide polymorphisms”, “paraoxonase-1
(PON1)”, and “neurodevelopment/neurobehavioural out-
come in child/infant”. Individual terms and a combination
of terms were used to search for articles. Unpublished
studies and the grey literature were not reviewed for this
search. Reference lists of retrieved articles were also
reviewed, and relevant articles were retrieved.
Criteria used for selecting studies
Inclusion criteria for selected articles were (a) articles
must be written in English, (b) articles must give details
of maternal pesticide exposure and (c) articles must
document the presence of single nucleotide polymor-
phisms in the PON1 gene and (d) neurobehavioural
health outcomes in children. Children were defined as
newborns to 16 years of age. Study designs which were
of interest in this review could either be of a prospective
cohort, longitudinal cohorts and case controlled studies.
Exclusion criteria were (a) articles published prior to the
year 2000, (b) articles in languages other than English
were excluded, (c) articles including pesticides other than
organophosphates were excluded, (d) if the evidence of
pesticide exposure was unclear or not documented the
article was excluded, (e) articles reporting on SNPs in
genes other than the PON1 gene were excluded and (f)
non-neurobehavioural health outcomes were excluded
from the search (Table 1).
Study selection process
The literature search strategy was developed by Nkosi-
nathi Banhela (NB) who is the first author on this paper
and was approved by his PhD supervisor, Dr Saloshni
Naidoo (SN) a co-author on this paper. Articles were
screened for inclusion eligibility in this study by NB and
confirmed by PN. Two reviewers (NB and PN) reviewed
the title, abstracts and full-text for eligibility of the
studies to be included in the current study, and a third
reviewer checked for discrepancies (SN). The online

search identified 179 relevant citations. The titles and
abstracts of 76 articles were reviewed in detail; 103 arti-
cles were reviewed not to be in line with the inclusion cri-
teria. After a thorough review of the titles and abstracts of
articles, the full-texts of 49 articles were retrieved and
screened; 27 articles were not in congruency with the inclu-
sion criteria. Six articles met the inclusion criteria. Figure 1
summarises the online search using the PRISMA flow
diagram. The reference manager tool that was used to rec-
ord and manage the referencing and the reference list is
“Endnote X9” referencing managing software (Table 2).
Data extraction and presentation
Data from the selected articles were extracted into an
Excel spreadsheet. The Excel spreadsheet was structured
to visualise alignment of selected articles with the inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria. NB performed the initial syn-
thesis of collected data; PN verified and checked the
reported findings on data. Data were extracted relating
to the study title, authors, publication year, sample size,
study design, biological sample analysed, neurobeha-
vioural tests used, age of children assessed and outcomes
of neurobehavioural tests (see Table 3).
Data synthesis and analysis
Data from articles selected to be included were tabu-
lated to represent study sample size, study design,
screening tool used to measure pesticide of interest,
genotype of
interest, neurodevelopmental tool used
and age it was administered. The above-mentioned
parameter was then compared among the articles se-
lected for inclusion in the study. Further, the PON1
genotype was associated with the observed/screened
neurobehavioural outcome and the statistical score
used for the associations (see Table 4). Neurobeha-
vioural outcomes explored in each selected article
were characterised to have either cognitive, behavioural,
sensory, motor and morphological effect. A meta-analysis
for the current available data could not be performed as
there were no randomised controlled trials found in the
literature. While the health outcomes under study were in
the same category of neurodevelopmental outcomes,

different measuring instruments were used by the studies.
The neurobehavioural tests in the different papers ren-
dered results which were either behavioural, cognitive,
sensory, motor or morphological, making it difficult to
compare for a meta-analysis.

quality of studies based on selection bias, study design,
confounders, blinding, data collection tools, withdrawal
and drop-outs, intervention integrity and analysis. The
first author (NB) performed the quality appraisal for ar-
ticles that were in-line with our current study; then, the
reviewer (PN) performed the quality appraisal according
to his judgement for the selected articles. Reviewers then
cross-checked if the appraisal had any differences which
were settled by the third reviewer (SN) (as she is the au-
thor that is most experienced in this study). Studies which
showed poor quality (< 4 score) were excluded from the
review. Articles with a moderate to a strong rating were
included in the study (see Tables 2, 5, and 6).
Results
Based on the search strategy employed, six articles met
the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Summary character-
istics of the included studies appear in Table 1.

Study design and location of the studies
In four of the articles included in this review, the studies
followed a cohort study design [5, 21, 26, 29], whilst the
remainder two articles followed a case-control study
design [21, 28]. Two articles emanated from one study
[5, 21]. Four of the papers reported on studies in the
USA [12, 18, 21, 22]; one study involved Italian and
Canadian participants [27] and one study was based in
Romania [28]. Quality assessment of selected articles in-
dicated that most of the articles selected for the study
were of a good quality rating, except the article by Pasca
et al. which did not report on pesticide exposure.
Study participants and sample size
Four articles reported on mother and child pairs [5, 21,
26, 29], whilst one study reported on children [28]. The
age of children assessed ranged from 1 to 9 years in the
selected articles. One article assessed children at three
stages (one, two and 6 to 9 years) [29], whilst another

[21]. One article assessed children at only one age point,
at 2 years [25] and one article at 8 years [26]. The age of
children in one article was not reported [28].
Exposure measurement
In three articles [5, 21, 29], urinary samples were taken
to assess prenatal pesticide exposure. In one article [27],
urinary peptides were measured. In all the articles, blood
samples were taken for PON1 SNP genotyping and en-
zyme assessment. Four articles [5, 21, 26, 29] included in
this review explored pesticide load using gas chromatog-
raphy tandem mass spectrometry (GC/MS). One article
[27] used high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) [25] whilst another used an enzymatic activity
assay [28] to quantify pesticide exposure.
Genetic outcome analysis
Four articles reported on the PON1 (108T) SNP [5, 21, 26,
27], whilst two articles reported on the PON1 (L55M) SNP
[27, 28]. All six articles reported on the PON1 (Q192R)
SNP. Other SNPs which have been explored by researchers
were not included because of their associated health out-
come being outside the scope of this study. It was deduced

Neurobehavioural tools used to assess outcomes
Children assessed for neurobehavioural health outcomes
were between the age(s) of 1 to 9 years old. Tools used to
assess neurobehavioural health outcomes in the included
studies were the Bayley Scale of Infant Development
(BSID) (two articles [5, 29]) which measures the Mental
Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Develop-
ment Index (PDI), the Conners’ Kiddie Continuous Per-
formance Test (K-CPT) (one article [21]), the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale (WISC) for Children (one article [21])
and the Behaviour Assessment System for Children-2
(BASC2) (one article [26]). Two articles included in the re-
view [27, 28] reported on autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
and used a physician diagnosis of autism using the stand-
ard approved diagnostic method.
Association of PON1 polymorphism with neurobehaviour
health outcome in children (Tables 3 and 4)

the remaining three articles [23–25]. Eskenazi et al.
quantified maternal urine dialkyphosphate (DAP) levels,
genotyped the PON1 gene for PON1 192 and PON1 108
polymorphism and measured the enzymatic activity of
paraoxonase (POase) and arylesterase (ARYase). The
PON1 108T allele in children was associated with poorer
MDI scores and high DAP levels [5]. However, other
PON1 polymorphic variants and enzymes showed no
significant association. The association of
the PON1
108TT allele with poorer/low neurofunction scores was
further reported in a follow-up study of the same cohort
[21]. In this paper [22], maternal PON1 108T allele car-
riers showed a weakly modified relationship between
DAP and neurobehaviour. Engel et al. found the PON 1
Q192R QR/RR variant genotype to be associated with
poorer perceptual reasoning and increasing dialkyl- and
dimethylphosphate (DAP and DMP) concentrations in
urine. The adverse neurobehavioural health outcome in
children was observed from 12 months of age and con-
tinued up to 9 years of age [29]. The low enzymatic ac-
tivity was associated with the PON1 Q192R allele and
with exposure to DAP and DMP [21]. ARYase and
POase levels and activity were also reported to be associ-
ated with the neurodevelopment hindrance, leading to
autism spectrum disorders in Romanian children [28].
However, the above-mentioned study did not find any
significant association in PON1 allelic distribution [28].
The PON1 R192 gene variant was implicated in the
pathogenesis of autism among North American (Cauca-
sian), but not Italian, organophosphate users [27].
Discussion
The articles show that organophosphate (OP) and me-
tabolite exposure is implicated in the pathogenesis of
adverse neurobehavioural health outcomes. Pesticide ap-
plication at home or in the work place may play a role
in the development of adverse neurobehavioural health
outcomes, especially if exposure is directed to pregnant
women who are likely to transfer their pesticide load to
the unborn child [21]. The pesticide load is likely to
cause prominent changes on the genetic variability of
selected genes, as the chemical structure of pesticides
has been proven to be genotoxic and ultimately neuro-
toxic [6]. The articles included in this study show that
pesticide exposure (in this case organophosphate and
metabolites)
induces a pressure on the PON1 gene,
which resulted in low enzymatic activity of specific en-
zymes and has been associated with low neurobeha-
vioural scores [5, 22, 28, 30].
Polymorphic variants on the PON1 gene show great
variability which may influence the activity and function-
ality of enzymes encoded by that gene [29]. The PON1
SNPs which have been implicated with adverse neurobe-
havioural function are the PON1 108T and Q192R [21,
29]. The PON1 L55M allele has been implicated in the
aetiology of other health outcomes (i.e. atherosclerosis,
cancer and leukaemia) besides those of neurobehaviour
dysfunction [27]. Maternal PON1 can affect polymorphic
status of neurobehaviour function in children [21]. The
PON1 L55M allele is rather associated with influencing
the plasma enzymatic levels [3]. Prenatal exposure to OP
is likely to induce low enzymatic activity (ARYase and
POase) which consequently leads to reduced neurobeha-
vioural function scores [5]. The reduction in neurobeha-
vioural function score can be observed from 1 to 9 years
of age [5, 29]. The PON1 192R(+) allele was found to be
common among pesticide exposed groups and was asso-
ciated with increased paraoxonase and acetylcholinester-
ase activity [31].
Prenatal exposure to OP may place children at risk of
developing neurobehavioural hindrance,
in some cases
leading to the development of autism and autism
spectrum disorders (ASD) [27, 28]. In the two articles
included in this review, the PON1 108T allele was asso-
ciated with autism but not significantly [20, 21]. This
non-significance may be because of the small sample
size in the studies. The PON1 108T (+) and the 192R
(+) alleles have been associated with adverse health out-
comes in other studies [3, 31].
Neurobehavioural
function and PON1 polymorphic
status, due to OP exposure, may be difficult to grade as
it is age and ethnic group dependant [21, 27]. However,
the researchers in the articles used standardised age ap-
propriate tests. What would have been interesting would
be if all the studies had used similar neurobehavioural
function screening tests and exposure screening tools,
enabling a more in-depth analysis of the results of the
studies included.
Limitations of this review
This was a comprehensive review of the literature and
was inclusive of all nationalities or geographical location
literature, as long it was in line with the search term
combination used. However, there are some limitations
which need to be noted. Our search was limited to arti-
cles published between 2000 and 2018 with the result
that articles published prior to this date that may con-
tain important information have not been included in
this review. English language articles were only consid-
ered, and so studies in other languages may have been
omitted. The studies were largely in Caucasian popula-
tions, and studies in other ethnic groups may show dif-
ferent findings.
A further limitation is that not all the papers clearly
defined the exact pesticide exposure concentration that
is associated with an adverse health outcome. Articles
not clearly reporting on the pre- and postnatal exposure
to organophosphate and/or any of its metabolites could

not be included in this review. Most articles in line with
the study title were not included because of the pesticide
of interest and health outcome. It was observed that
most articles explored pesticide exposure in association
with a variety of health outcomes which were not of
interest to the current study. This would have affected
the synthesis of this study differently as there are many
studies which have evaluated the association of
the
PON1 gene with other health outcomes besides the neu-
robehavioural ones. There were articles, which explored
the association between the PON1 SNP and neurobeha-
vioural health outcomes, and other environmental toxi-
cants besides organophosphates. Most articles used urine
and blood samples to quantify pesticide load, whilst others
used enzymatic activity.
Conclusion
This systematic review of the peer reviewed literature
shows an association between prenatal organophos-
phates exposure and PON1 SNP, with neurobehavioural
health outcomes. According to our knowledge, this is
the first systematic review which explored the associ-
ation of pesticide exposure with PON1 genotype and
neurobehavioural health outcomes.
Association between prenatal pesticide exposure and
SNP presence on PON1 gene needs to be further investi-
gated to obtain a succinct understanding of how it can
affect neurobehaviour. Current literature indicates that
prenatal pesticide exposure affects neurodevelopment by
influencing the genotype of the PON1 gene, which sub-
sequently alters POase and ARYase activity.
