Maternal smoking and autism 
spectrum disorder: meta-analysis 
with population smoking metrics as 
moderators
Yonwoo Jung1,2, Angela M. Lee 
While exposure to nicotine during developmental periods can significantly affect brain development, 
studies examining the association between maternal smoking and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) 
in offspring have produced conflicting findings, and prior meta-analyses have found no significant 
association. Our meta-analysis used a novel approach of investigating population-level smoking metrics 
as moderators. The main meta-analysis, with 22 observational studies comprising 795,632 cases and 
1,829,256 control participants, used a random-effects model to find no significant association between 
maternal smoking during pregnancy and ASD in offspring (pooled odds ratio (OR) = 1.16, 95% CI: 
0.97–1.40). However, meta-regression analyses with moderators were significant when we matched 
pooled ORs with adult male smoking prevalence (z = 2.55, p = 0.01) in each country, using World Health 
Organization data. Our study shows that using population-level smoking metrics uncovers significant 
relationships between maternal smoking and ASD risk. Correlational analyses show that male smoking 
prevalence approximates secondhand smoke exposure. While we cannot exclude the possibility that 
our findings reflect the role of paternal or postnatal nicotine exposure, as opposed to maternal or in 
utero nicotine exposure, this study underlines the importance of investigating paternal and secondhand 
smoking in addition to maternal smoking in ASD.
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by persistent difficulties in reciprocal social interaction and in 
verbal and nonverbal communication skills. Restrictive and repetitive behavioral symptoms and stereotyped pat-
terns of interest are characterized to varying degrees1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate 
that 1 in 68 children have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), accounting for more than 3.5 
million disability-adjusted life years in America2.
ASDs are considered multifactorial disorders that arise from an interaction between genetics and environ-
mental factors. Several genomics studies have revealed single nucleotide polymorphisms, copy-number varia-
tions, and de novo mutations that are associated with ASD3–6. However, other studies highlight the fact that most 
genetic risk factors, while able to influence the ASD phenotype, cannot independently produce ASD7, 8. Current 
studies have been exploring environmental factors (ex: viral infection, environmental toxins, gestational diabe-
tes) possibly involved in ASD etiology9. Identifying controllable environmental risk factors will be important for 
preventing ASD.
One such environmental risk factor that has garnered interest is smoking tobacco. A combination of animal 
studies and human epidemiological studies point to a plausible relationship between maternal smoking and ASD 
in offspring. Nicotine, among the thousands of ingredients of tobacco smoke, is the chemical with the high-
est likelihood of adversely affecting brain development10. Nicotine’s adverse effects are thought to occur via its 
actions at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which mediate neural structural changes11, 12, that in turn can have 
significant consequences for the offspring in later life. In mice, developmental nicotine exposure in utero and up 
to postnatal day 21 significantly affected neuronal dendritic morphology and behavior in a passive avoidance 
paradigm11. Human studies have shown that socioeconomic status (SES) is significantly associated with ASD13,

and that women with lower SES have a higher tendency to smoke during pregnancy14. Additionally, smoking is 
associated with adverse birth outcomes, such as fetal growth restriction and low birth weight15, which are in turn 
associated with increased risk of ASD16. Smoking during pregnancy has also been associated with neurodevel-
opmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and antisocial behavior17.
Epidemiological studies exploring the relationship of maternal smoking during pregnancy and ASD have 
produced contradictory results. For example, in Swedish populations, Lee et al.18 found no evidence of an asso-
ciation between maternal smoking and ASD risk, while Larsson et al.19 found a positive association (OR = 2.09, 
95% CI: 1.08–4.03), and Haglund et al.20 found a negative association (OR = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.5–1.0). Similarly, 
positive21, 22, negative23, 24, and null25–28 associations have been observed in United States study populations. Three 
meta-analyses have also been conducted, each finding no evidence for a significant association between maternal 
smoking and ASD risk in offspring. Gardener et al.29 included 5 studies and reported an overall OR of 1.00 (95% 
CI: 0.75–1.36). Rosen et al.30 included 15 studies and found a summary OR of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93–1.12), while 
Tang et al.31 analyzed a partially different set of 15 studies and found a summary OR of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.93–1.13). 
However, these prior meta-analyses failed to account for study-level and population-level factors regarding smoke 
exposure that may moderate the relationship between maternal smoking and ASD risk. Specifically, the studies 
do not systematically account for the possible role of indirect, secondhand smoke exposure; most of the observa-
tional studies included in these meta-analyses only reported active maternal smoking. This assessment alone may 
inadequately reflect total in utero nicotine exposure.
Here, we analyze population smoking prevalence in our meta-regression to investigate how these measures, as 
potential indicators of secondhand smoke exposure, might moderate the relationship between maternal smoking 
and ASD. Additionally, two studies22, 32 supporting an association between maternal smoking and ASD risk have 
been published after the most recent meta-analysis. One of the two studies32 is the first to report extractable data 
regarding maternal smoking and ASD in an Asian population. Previous meta-analyses have only included studies 
conducted in European or North American populations. Therefore, the current meta-analysis also included a 
subgroup analysis by study location. This study was conducted to assess the association between maternal smok-
ing and ASD risk comprehensively, and to examine study location and population smoking metrics as important 
study-level and population-level moderators of this relationship.
Results
Literature Search and Selection.  Our search strategy returned a total of 2,417 publications from 
PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases (Fig. 1). All references were imported into 
EndNote X7.6 (Thomson Reuters), which automatically removed 638 duplicates. An additional 129 duplicates 
were removed manually, leaving 1650 articles that were screened by titles and abstracts for relevance to maternal 
smoking and ASD. Studies included in previously published meta-analyses30, 31 were also evaluated for inclusion 
criteria. After screening, 26 studies remained for detailed evaluation of the full texts. Four articles33–36 were then 
excluded for lacking sufficient data to fill the contingency table of binary maternal smoking and ASD variables. 
Consequently, 22 articles17–28, 32, 37–45 were included for meta-analysis.
Study Characteristics.  The 22 studies analyzed include seven cohort studies19, 23, 39, 40, 43–45 and fifteen 
case-control studies17, 18, 20–22, 24–28, 32, 37, 38, 41, 42, with a total of 795,632 cases and 1,829,256 control participants. 
Nine studies17–20, 37, 38, 41, 42, 45 were from Europe (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, The Netherlands, and Poland), 
twelve studies21–28, 39, 40, 43, 44 were from North America (Canada and U.S.) and one study32 was from Asia (China). 
Information on smoking during pregnancy was collected during a prenatal visit or at birth in 11/22 studies, and 
ASD diagnosis was ascertained by medical records in 16/22 studies (Supplementary Table S1).

publication bias.
Quality Assessment and Publication Bias.  Two authors independently assigned Newcastle-Ottawa Scale 
(NOS) scores to each study, with high correlation between scorers (r(20) = 0.81, p < 0.00001) (Fig. 2a). Overall, 
the studies had moderate methodological quality as scored on a conservatively-interpreted NOS, with an average 
score of 6.5 and a range of 4–9. Based on thirds of the range of scores, four studies were considered “high” quality 
with NOS scores of 8 or 917, 22, 25, 37, ten studies were considered “medium” quality with NOS scores of 6 or 718, 21, 
23, 26, 38–40, 42, 44, 45, and eight studies were considered “low” quality with NOS scores of 4 to 5.519, 20, 24, 27, 28, 32, 41, 43  
(Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
The shape and symmetry of the funnel plot of the log ORs from the 22 studies are illustrated in Fig. 2b. Begg’s 
rank correlation test (p = 0.27) and Egger’s regression test (p = 0.54) suggest no significant publication bias46, 47.
Main Analysis.  The pooled OR estimates showed that maternal smoking during pregnancy was not associ-
ated with a significantly increased risk of ASDs (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.97–1.40) (Fig. 3). A statistically significant 
level of heterogeneity was found across studies (I 2 = 94.08%, Q(21) = 156.94, p < 0.0001).
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses, and Moderator Analysis with Meta-regression.  To identify 
potential causes of the high heterogeneity in our main analysis, we performed subgroup and sensitivity analy-
ses. Subgroup analyses were stratified by study design, location, sample size, quality, adjustment for confound-
ers, maternal smoking assessment, and ASD status ascertainment (Table 1, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). 
Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with significantly elevated risk of ASD in European popula-
tions (OR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.08–1.19) and in the single study conducted in Asia (OR = 3.02, 95% CI: 1.93–4.73), 
but not in North American populations (OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.77–1.28). Maternal smoking was also associ-
ated with elevated ASD risk in studies with the lowest quartile of sample sizes (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.12–2.33). 
Subgroup analyses by study design, study quality, and adjustment for confounders showed no significant dif-
ferences in pooled ORs across strata. Assessment of maternal smoking at a prenatal visit (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 
1.03–1.17) or after birth (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.37–2.42) showed significant associations with ASD in offspring, 
whereas assessment at birth (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65–0.85) had an apparent protective effect (Table 1). For the 
sensitivity analysis, the pooled ORs varied moderately, ranging from 1.08 (95% CI: 0.92–1.29) when Gao et al.32 
was excluded to 1.17 (95% CI: 0.98–1.47) when Bilder et al.25 was excluded. Case deletion diagnostics identified 
Talbott et al.22 as a potential outlier. The main meta-analysis without Talbott et al. resulted in a similar pooled OR 
(OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.94–1.33) as the original analysis (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 0.97–1.40).
Interestingly, subgroup analysis using meta-regression with a continuous moderator found that smoking 
prevalence in males in the country of each study had a significant influence on ASD risk after maternal smoking 
(z = 2.33, p < 0.05). The results also showed that the OR increased with increasing smoking prevalance percent-
age. Therefore, we used the prediction function to obtain the average log OR values for the smoking prevalence 
percentages while holding the year constant. Smoking prevalence in males by country showed a significant corre-
lation with ASD risk (z = 2.55, p = 0.011) (Fig. 4a). In contrast, smoking prevalence in females by country did not 
have a statistically significant correlation, (z = −1.13, p = 0.26) (Fig. 4b).
Correlations between population smoking metrics and measures of secondhand smoke expo-
sure.  Reports of secondhand smoke exposure in either youth48 or in female adults49 were only available for 
three (U.S., China, Poland) of the eight countries represented in our study, precluding direct use of secondhand 
smoke measures in our meta-analyses. Therefore, we performed linear regression analyses to test the relationship 
between the population smoking metrics used in our analysis and the secondhand smoke exposure data we 
extracted from global survey reports. These analyses showed significant positive correlations between smoking 
prevalence in adult males with youth reports of smoke exposure in the home (r(108) = 0.63, p < 0.0001) and 
outside the home (r(106) = 0.61, p < 0.001) (Fig. 5a). Smoking prevalence in adult females also had significant

reports of secondhand smoke exposure at home (r(18) = −0.011, p = 0.96) or at work (r(21) = −0.17, p = 0.44) 
(Fig. 5d).
Discussion
The present study used a comprehensive search strategy and explored the relationship between maternal smoking 
during pregnancy and ASD in offspring. Three previously published meta-analyses have shown no significant 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring, analyzing 5 or 15 individual studies29–31. Our main 
analysis, which included 22 studies and is the first to include an observational study in an Asian population, also 
showed no significant association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and ASD (Fig. 3). To deter-
mine the source of the substantial heterogeneity in our main analysis, we performed subgroup analyses using 
meta-regression with various modalities. We produced novel findings by comparing results by study location 
and by using population-level measures of tobacco consumption. In subgroup analyses, a significant positive 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in the offspring was observed in studies conducted in China 
and Europe, but not those in North America. Correlating with these relative rankings, the smoking population 
of adult males in China and the European countries represented in this analysis, except Sweden, are higher than 
the adult male smoking populations in the U.S. and Canada (Table S2). Our meta-regression analysis with adult 
male smoking prevalence in each country as a continuous moderator also indicated a significant correlation with 
ASD risk (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, adult male smoking prevalence was strongly correlated with rates of secondhand 
smoke exposure reported by youth and adult women (Fig. 5). These results suggest that maternal tobacco expo-
sure may indeed increase ASD risk in offspring, but that exclusively assessing active maternal smoking under-
estimates total exposure, which includes secondhand smoke, before or after birth. Measures of smoking in the 
overall population may provide this missing measure of secondhand smoke exposure, thereby modulating the 
relationship between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring to produce significant correlations.
Two important limitations of using the smoking prevalence data should be noted. First, the 2008 smoking 
prevalence data were used for all subjects included in the meta-analysis, who were born between 1980–2012. 
The 2008 report was chosen because it was the earliest report to comprehensively and systematically measure 
smoking prevalence in member countries. However, our meta-analytic approach and the wide range of birth

years represented makes it impossible to precisely match population smoking indices to the subjects’ gestation. 
Indeed, we cannot exclude the possibility that male smoking may contribute to exposure after birth, not dur-
ing gestation. Future studies could more accurately track this information by collecting information regarding 
secondhand smoke exposure directly from the mothers in observational studies. Secondly, the trend towards a 
negative correlation between OR of ASD risk and smoking prevalence in women, although not statistically sig-
nificant, seems incongruent with the idea that this metric captures an important measure of secondhand smoke 
exposure. However, we found that female smoking prevalence, compared to male smoking prevalence, was less 
strongly correlated with secondhand smoke exposure (Fig. 5). It is also possible that these results may be skewed 
by the extremely low smoking prevalence in females in China, where only 3.7% of women reported current smok-
ing, compared to 21.5–30.6% of women in other countries48. Such low smoking rates in women have also been 
observed in other Asian countries such as South Korea, where 7.1% of women smoked according to in-person 
self-report surveys, but 18.2% of women smoked according to urine cotinine content50. In comparison, 47.8% 
of men smoked according to self-reports, and 55.1% of men smoked according to urine cotinine content. There 
may be a similarly disproportionate degree of underreporting in Chinese women, especially around pregnancy51, 
thereby skewing the data towards a negative trend.
An alternate explanation is that the significant correlations between OR and male smoking prevalence indicate 
a primary effect of paternal smoking on ASD in offspring, rather than through secondhand smoke exposure in 
the mother. There is evidence that smoking induces significant changes of DNA methylation in sperm52, 53. DNA 
methylation is associated with changes in the gene expression profile. In utero nicotine exposure in mice has been 
shown to induce such changes in gene expression through epigenetic modification11. Therefore, it would not be 
surprising if both maternal and paternal smoking contribute to changes in gene expression underlying brain 
development. However, three studies included in our meta-analysis examined secondhand smoke exposure dur-
ing pregnancy, and their findings suggest that smoking increases ASD risk in offspring primarily through in utero 
exposure19, 32, 41. Furthermore, two other studies conducted in Chinese populations reported positive associations 
between passive maternal smoke exposure and ASD54, 55. The passive smoke exposure in these studies was not 
exclusive to paternal smoking and included, for example, exposure from smoking colleagues; active maternal 
smoking data was not reported. Together, these results suggest that paternal smoking may be an important factor 
for its impact on maternal smoke exposure during pregnancy, rather than for direct effects on the father’s role in 
reproduction.

Importantly, population-level smoking is one of many possible risk factors for ASD. Results of our subgroup 
and moderator analyses indicated that population-level tobacco consumption, study location, and study sample 
size could only account for 14% of the total heterogeneity found in this analysis. As noted in the introduction, 
there are several adverse outcomes, such as low birth weight, linked to both maternal smoking and to ASD, 
that not only suggest maternal smoking is a plausible environmental cause of ASD, but also pose potential con-
founds for studying the direct association between ASD and maternal smoking. Several observational studies 
included in our meta-analysis adjusted for potential confounding factors, either by matching controls to cases on 
6
characteristics of interest (e.g., birth year and gender)25, 32, or by adjusting their statistical analysis for potential 
confounds (e.g., parental age, parental education, parental occupational class, family income, maternal origin of 
birth, and Apgar score)18, 41. Our study examined adjustment for confounding factors as a potential moderator 
and, similar to others30, 31, found no differences in our subgroup analyses. However, contributions of these factors 
cannot be entirely ruled out.
One significant result from our subgroup analyses was that maternal smoking was associated with elevated 
ASD risk in studies with the lowest quartile of sample sizes (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.12–2.33) (Table 1). Interestingly, 
all six studies in the lowest quartile of sample sizes assessed maternal smoking exposure after birth; subgroup 
analyses showed that this method of maternal smoking assessment, used in 9/22 studies, was also associated with 
an increased risk of ASD (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.37–2.42) (Table 1). Additionally, all 4/22 studies that diagnosed 
ASD by direct evaluation are represented in the lowest quartile of samples sizes. The significance of this obser-
vation is unclear; it may be that studies directly evaluating ASD had small sample sizes necessitated by limited 
resources, and that the significant effect of sample size in our subgroup analysis is due to sampling bias. Overall, 
there is still a large portion of heterogeneity in our analyses that is not accounted for.
There are also general limitations to consider regarding ascertainment of exposure and case definition. First, 
half of the studies (11/22) relied on retrospective reporting, which many believe may be more vulnerable to faulty 
recall and bias than prospective reporting, especially if reported after an ASD diagnosis30. In both this and a pre-
vious meta-analysis30, subgroup analyses showed that assessing maternal smoking at birth had an apparent pro-
tective effect, while assessment after birth produced the highest OR for ASD risk (Table 1). Interestingly, whereas 
Rosen et al.30 found that prenatal assessment resulted in no significant relationship between maternal smoking and 
ASD, our study found a small but significant effect in the prenatally assessed subgroup of studies (OR = 1.10, 95% 
CI: 1.03–1.17). Empirically, studies have shown that retrospective reporting is overall accurate and reliable56, 57.  
One study found that retrospective recall of any smoking in pregnancy, an average of 14.5 years later, had 95.6% 
and 80.3% sensitivity when compared to positive urine cotinine tests during pregnancy and prospective reporting 
at the first antenatal visit, respectively, and 93.2% and 92.9% specificity, respectively, when including only women 
who recalled any smoking after learning of pregnancy58. Importantly, the study also found that there were no 
differences in child behavior problems, specifically conduct disorder symptoms and antisocial behaviors, between 
mothers’ whose retrospective recall of smoking status was or was not congruent with prospective reporting or 
cotinine levels. Therefore, the number of studies relying on retrospective reporting in our meta-analysis is likely 
not a significant issue, and the results of the subgroup analyses in prenatally and postnatally assessed mothers 
may accurately reflect a positive association. Second, while retrospective timing of reporting may not be uniquely 
susceptible to bias, self-reporting of maternal smoking may be particularly underreported if women are aware of 
its adverse health consequences and/or perceive social disapproval51.
More importantly, self-reporting of active smoking alone likely misrepresents total nicotine exposure. In 
China, 57% of women reported exposure to secondhand smoke59. In New York City, 46.8% (102/218) of preg-
nant women who were nonsmokers were found to have serum cotinine levels indicating secondhand smoke 
exposure60. The results of our moderator analyses indicate a significant relationship between the risk of ASD in 
children whose mothers’ smoked during pregnancy and male population smoking prevalence, which in turn was 
significantly correlated with reports of secondhand smoke exposure in youth and female adults. Together, these 
data may suggest that reports of active smoking alone neglects to account for nicotine exposure from secondhand 
smoking, which when accounted for may provide new insight into relationships between maternal exposures and 
subsequent child outcomes.
Another potential limitation is our broad definition of maternal smoking as any smoking during pregnancy, 
which may have skewed our main analysis towards a null association if in utero nicotine exposure must meet 
some threshold to increase ASD risk. Studies of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder risk after exposure to 
maternal smoking in pregnancy suggest there may be such a dose effect61; if also true for ASD, it would align with 
our interpretation that population smoking metrics capture secondhand smoke exposure, which increases total 
in utero nicotine dose and therefore significantly predicts ASD risk. In the observational studies included in our 
meta-analysis, only Haglund et al.20 reported smoking dosage20.
Limitations are also inherent in determining case or control status. Our subgroup analyses showed no dif-
ferences in ORs when ASD status was determined by direct evaluation or by medical or developmental records; 
parental reporting of ASD status, in the only two studies using this method, resulted in a positive association 
(OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.23–2.35) (Table 1). Diagnoses were variably based on DSM-III, DSM-IV, DSM-IV-TR, 
or DSM-V criteria. Our definition for positive ASD status was also broad and included all subtypes, such as 
Asperger’s and Persistent Developmental Disorder, if reported separately. Additionally, in one study, we used 
a group with intellectual disability (ID) but without an ASD diagnosis as the control group, and ASD with or 
without ID as the case group24. It is unclear whether the various ASD subtypes have different etiologies, either 
in general or specifically in relation to maternal smoking62. Future studies that more rigorously and consistently 
distinguish between subtypes may yield more information.
In summary, our study included 22 observational studies and is the first to include one conducted in an Asian 
population32. While our main meta-analysis is consistent with previous meta-analyses in finding no significant 
association between maternal smoking and ASD in offspring, our subgroup and moderator analyses with pop-
ulation smoking metrics suggest that a more nuanced interpretation of this null association is warranted. In 
future studies, more consistent and systematic examination of non-maternal sources of in utero or developmental 
nicotine exposure, such as smoking in the fathers, household, or general population, may yield important results.
Methods
Data Sources and Searches.  We followed PRIMSA-P guidelines63 for meta-analytic studies. Literature 
searches were conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library to identify peer-reviewed 
7
studies published through May 2016 with the following search term: [(smoke ∪ smoking ∪ cigarette ∪ tobacco ∪ 
risk factors) ∩ (autism spectrum disorder ∪ autism) ∩ (pregnancy ∪ prenatal ∪ perinatal ∪ Maternal ∪ Paternal 
∪ Parental)]. No language restrictions were applied. Additionally, studies used in previously published meta-anal-
yses were evaluated for inclusion. Country-specific data on population smoking metrics were extracted from 
World Health Organization (WHO) reports of adult smoking prevalence for the year 2008, separated by sex48. 
Smoking was defined as any current smoking at the time of data collection, and age-standardized estimates of 
smoking prevalence were extracted to allow comparison between countries. Data on secondhand smoke expo-
sure were extracted from the Global Youth Tobacco Survey as reported in the same 2008 WHO report from 
which adult smoking prevalence data were extracted. Exposure to smoke was defined as “during the last seven 
days prior to the survey, people smoked at least once in the presence of the interviewee,” and was reported by 
youths 13–15 years old for exposure inside the home and outside the home48. The Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention’s (CDC) Global Tobacco Surveillance System (GTSS) data portal was used to access additional data 
from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), from which data on adult reports of secondhand smoke exposure 
and prevalence of any current smoking in males and females were extracted by country49. Since our study focuses 
on maternal smoking, we extracted data on female adults’ reports of exposure to secondhand smoking at home 
(any smoking in home) and at work (in the past 30 days).
Study Selection.  Full texts of potentially relevant reports were examined for the following inclusion criteria: 
(i) a cohort or case-control design and (ii) data reported in such a way that the authors could extract or calculate 
the number of ASD cases with mothers who did and did not smoke during pregnancy, and control subjects with 
mothers who did and did not smoke during pregnancy. Two authors (YJ, AML) independently confirmed fulfill-
ment of inclusion criteria.
Data Extraction and Quality Assessment. 
Information was extracted from each study as a contingency 
table using a binary maternal smoking variable and a binary ASD variable. Any maternal smoke exposure during 
pregnancy was considered positive for maternal smoking, and any ASD in offspring, regardless of subtype, was 
considered positive for ASD. Two authors (YJ, AML) independently extracted data and resolved any disagree-
ments by discussion. Additionally, the following data were extracted: last name of the first author, publication 
year, study design, study location, maternal smoking assessment method, ASD status assessment method, and 
unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI), or alternate statistic if reported, 
and whether any adjustments for confounders were made in either participant selection or statistical analysis.
Two authors (YJ, AML) used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to assess methodological quality64. A max-
imum of nine points was assigned for eight items in three categories, Selection, Comparability, and Exposure. 
First, each author independently determined preliminary NOS scores for each study, which were discussed to 
arrive at a consensus definition of the eight items to be scored. Subsequently, the authors independently re-scored 
each study according to the agreed-upon criteria, and averaged their scores.
Data Analysis.  Unadjusted ORs were calculated from the contingency tables abstracted from each study 
and combined to produce a measure of the association between maternal smoking and ASD risk. Cochrane Q 
statistic (significance level at p < 0.10) and the I2 statistic were used to assess the heterogeneity of studies65, 66. A 
random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled OR in the context of a general linear model. Smoking prev-
alence in adult males or in adult females was used as a continuous moderator in the mixed-effects model to exam-
ine to what extent these moderators influence the strength of the relationship between maternal smoking and 
autism. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess whether any individual study significantly affected pooled 
estimates by omitting one study in each turn using meta-regression fitting. Outliers or influencers in the stud-
ies were diagnosed by examining studentized deleted residuals (rstudent), difference of predicted average effect 
(DIFFITS), and total changes in parameter estimate (Cook’s distance) in meta-regression fitting. Additionally, 
subgroup analyses were performed to examine study design (case-control or cohort), location (by continent), 
sample size (by quartile), quality (NOS score high, medium, or low), adjustment for confounders (yes/no), timing 
of maternal smoking assessment (prenatal visit, at birth, after birth), and method of ascertaining ASD diagnosis 
(direct evaluation, medical or developmental record, parental report). Begg’s rank correlation and Egger’s regres-
sion tests were used to detect publication bias46. Metafor67 R package was used for all meta-analyses. GraphPad 
Prism version 7.0 was used to calculate Pearson’s correlation coefficient, r, to test for correlation between two 
authors’ independent NOS ratings, and to test for correlations between population smoking metrics and measures 
of secondhand smoke exposure. The correlation between female smoking prevalence and female adult smoke 
exposure based on GATS data was computed as a nonparametric Spearman correlation due to the non-Gaussian 
distribution of data. All statistical tests had a significance level of p ≤ 0.05, unless otherwise specified.
Statistics.  To determine the effect of moderators, a mixed-effects model was used, in which the unknown 
true effect, yi, is given by yi = β0 + β1xi1 + … + βpxip + ui + ei, where xip denotes the value of the pth moderator 
for the ith study, and βp denotes the change in the average true effect for a one unit increase in xip. The Metafor 
package is advantageous because it allows such mixed-effects models to be fitted with continuous or categorical 
x moderator variables, compared to previous packages that only allow categorical moderator variables to be fit-
ted. Additionally, ui ~ N(0, τ2) where τ2 denotes the residual heterogeneity not accounted for by the moderators 
included in the model, and ei ~ N(0, vi) where vi denotes sampling variances. Some assumptions underlying the 
meta-analysis conducted by Metafor in general include (1) treating sampling variances as if they were known con-
stants, (2) treating τ2 as a constant after it has been estimated and (3) assuming effect sizes are normally distrib-
uted67. Further explanation of this model can be found in the Metafor package manual68 and clinical vignette67.
