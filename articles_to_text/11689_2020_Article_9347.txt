Abstract
Background: Various techniques in assisted reproductive technology (ART) have been developed as solutions for
specific infertility problems. It is important to gain consensual conclusions on the actual risks of
neurodevelopmental disorders among children who are born from ART. This study aimed to quantify the relative
risks of cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and behavioral problems in children
from different ART methods by using systematic review and meta-analysis. Healthcare providers could use the
results of this study to suggest the suitable ART technique and plan optimum postnatal care.
Methods: Pubmed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases were used to search for studies up to January 2020. Of
the 181 screened full manuscripts, 17 studies (9.39%) fulfilled the selection criteria. Based on the Newcastle-Ottawa
scale ratings, 7 studies were excluded, resulting in 10 studies that were eventually included in the meta-analyses.
Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio model was used in the meta-analysis, and the results are described using forest plot with
95% confidence interval. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 value.
Results: Pooled evaluation of 10 studies showed that the risk of cerebral palsy in children from assisted
reproductive technology (ART) is higher than children from natural conceptions (risk ratio [RR] 1.82, [1.41, 2.34];
P = 0.00001). Risk of intellectual disability (RR 1.46, [1.03, 2.08]; P = 0.03) and ASD (RR 1.49 [1.05, 2.11]; P = 0.03) are
higher in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) children compared to conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF)
children. The differences in the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders in children born after frozen and fresh embryo
transfers are not significant. Analysis on potential cofounder effects, including multiple birth, preterm birth, and low
birth body weight highlight possibilities of significant correlation to the risks of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Conclusions: Pooled estimates suggest that children born after ART are at higher risk of acquiring cerebral palsy.
ICSI treatment causes higher risk of intellectual disability and ASD. These findings suggest the importance of the
availability of intensive care unit at the time of delivery and long-term developmental evaluation particularly in
children from ICSI.

Introduction
The dreams of many infertile couples to have offspring(s)
have been made possible by assisted reproductive technol-
ogy (ART). Through its constant development, morbidity
due to infertility has been massively decreased [1]. Every
technique, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
and frozen embryo transfer, is designed as solutions for
specific problems. For example, in cases where two previ-
ous conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) failed, or if the
majority of sperms are immotile, ICSI is the technique
that offers the highest possibility to acquire pregnancy(-
ies) [2]. Meanwhile, when couples preferred to obtain
pregnancy(-ies) at later stage(s), cryopreservation enables
them to freeze embryos for implantation at later times [3].
Studies on prenatal and postnatal outcomes in ART,
such as the risks of multiple pregnancies and congenital
malformations, have
already been comprehensively
reviewed and meta-analyzed on previous publications
[4–10]. Conversely,
lesser number of studies have fo-
cused on the neurodevelopmental aspects of children
from ART. The nature of certain neurodevelopmental
disorders that might not be visible until later stage in
children’s
in obtaining long-term
follow-up, and the fact that many disorders can only be
diagnosed and treated in a multidisciplinary fashion
might be some of the reasons that caused limitation in
the number of studies on neurodevelopmental outcomes
in these children. Nonetheless, several studies have been
published to date, and it is important to gain consensual
conclusions on the actual risks of neurodevelopmental
disorders among these children.
lives, difficulties
This study aims to assess the risks of neurodevelop-
mental abnormalities in children from ART treatments,
in comparison to naturally conceived children through
meta-analysis. As different ART treatments may trans-
late into different pathophysiology, the neurodevelop-
mental outcomes
in children from different ART
techniques are also compared.
Methods
Literature search and identification
This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted
according
for
to the Preferred Reporting
Items
Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) [11]
reporting guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and Google
scholars’ databases were used to collect publications up
to January 16, 2020. The following search terms were
applied: reproductive techniques, assisted OR assisted
reproductive OR in vitro fertilization OR in vitro
fertilization AND Child development OR adolescent de-
velopment OR long term follow-up OR Developmental
disabilities OR Developmental disability OR Language
disorders OR Language disorder OR Neurodevelopment
OR mental disorder OR mental disorders OR neuro-
psychiatry. Additional studies were identified through
screening of the reference lists.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included if they (1) compared any neurode-
velopment aspects in ART children to children from
natural conceptions, and (2) described the neurodeve-
lopment in children from common ART techniques, in-
cluding conventional IVF, ICSI, cryopreserved, and fresh
embryo transfers, then compared them to either children
in general population or children conceived by different
treatment modalities. Studies were excluded if (1) infor-
mation were insufficient, particularly related to the sub-
jects and parameters in the study, (2) not including
original data, such as reviews, systematic reviews, com-
ments, or editorial
including control
group (e.g., case reports), or could not ascertain the used
fertility treatment, and (4) not written in English.
Data collection and analysis
The title and abstract of every article were independently
reviewed by 3 authors (TD, JKA, DH). If the abstract
met the inclusion criteria, the full-text article was thor-
oughly reviewed. Reference lists on the identified publi-
cations were screened for previously unidentified but
relevant studies. The following information were re-
trieved: author, country, publication year, number of pa-
tients, criteria of neurodevelopmental disorders, and the
patients’ neurodevelopmental outcomes. The quality of
methodology was assessed using the risk of bias criteria
that were specified in Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS)
(3) not

[12]. Based on the final ratings, high-quality studies
(NOS score > 7) were included in the meta-analyses.
Statistical analysis
Meta-analysis was performed using Mantel-Haenszel
risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval for dichot-
omous data. Meta-analysis was performed on subgroup
analysis based on the types of the acquired neurodeve-
lopmental disorders, including cerebral palsy, intellectual
disability, autism spectrum disorder, and behavioral
problems. To describe the overall risk of neurodevelop-
mental disorders, a meta-analysis of the overall data was
also conducted. The RevMan version 5.3 software
(Cochrane Collaboration) was used for these purposes.
Inconsistency index (I2) test, which ranges from 0 to
100%, was calculated to evaluate heterogeneity across
studies. Values above 50% or p value < 0.10 indicate a
significant heterogeneity. Regression-based Egger’s test
was used to evaluate small study effect and the risk of
publication bias. p values less than 0.05 were considered
as significant bias. Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment
tool (Cochrane Collaboration) was used to assess the
risk of bias. Certainty of the evidence quality was evalu-
ated by using the Guideline Development Tool by
GRADEpro.
Results
The literature searches identified 1511 studies. Addition-
ally, 32 studies were identified through reference screen-
ing (Fig. 1). In total, 181 full-text articles were reviewed,
and only 17 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Based
on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale ratings, 7 studies [13–19]
were excluded. Thus, 10 studies [20–29] were included
in the meta-analyses, including 8 cohorts and 2 case-
control studies. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale results for the
cohort studies are described on Supplemental Table 1,
while descriptions of
studies are
reviewed on Supplemental Table 2. Characteristics of
the included studies are presented on Supplemental
Table 3.
ART vs natural conception (non-art) (10 studies)
Risk of cerebral palsy
Prevalence of cerebral palsy was reported in 5 studies
[21, 22, 26, 27, 29]. ART was associated with higher risk
of cerebral palsy (RR 1.82 [1.41, 2.34], z = 4.61, p <
0.00001; I2 = 19%, p = 0.29) (Fig. 2a), with an absolute
risk of 7 per 1000 births at ART group and 4 per 1000
births at baseline population (Supplemental Table 5). No
risk of publication bias (Egger’s p = 0.501) and no small-
study bias (Habord’s p = 0.962, Peter’s p = 0.991) were
acknowledged (Supplemental Table 4).
the case-control
Risk of intellectual disability
Risk of intellectual disability (new terminology for men-
tal retardation in DSM-5 and ICD-11) [30] was reported
in 5 studies [20, 21, 26, 28, 29]. Risk of intellectual dis-
ability in children born after ART treatments was not
different from the risk in children from natural concep-
tions (RR 1.01 [0.85,1.21]; z = 0.14, p = 0.89; I2 = 49%, p
= 0.10) (Fig. 2b), with the same absolute risk of 3 per
1000 births (Supplemental Table 5). Risk of publication
bias (Egger’s p = 0.754) and small-study bias (Habord’s p
= 0.872, Peter’s p = 0.963) were undetected (Supplemen-
tal Table 4).
Risk of autism spectrum disorder
Six studies reported the risk of ASD [20, 21, 23–25, 28].
One study [24] was excluded as it did not include chil-
dren from natural conceptions as control. The risk of ac-
quiring ASD in ART children is insignificantly different
with its risk in naturally conceived children (RR 0.98
[0.86, 1.11], z = 0.33, p = 0.74; I2 = 0%, p = 0.72) (Fig. 2c),
with identical absolute risk at 6 per 1000 births (Supple-
mental Table 5). Risk of publication bias (Egger’s p =
0.290) and small-study bias (Habord’s p = 0.836, Peter’s
p = 0.506) were unidentified (Supplemental Table 4).
Behavioral problems
Risk of behavioral problems was reported in 2 studies
[20, 29], and the results showed no differences in this
risk between ART and naturally conceived group (RR
1.04 [0.89, 1.21], z = 0.48, p = 0.63; I2 = 11%, p = 0.29)
(Fig. 2d). The absolute risk is 19 children per 1000 births
at ART group and 18 per 1000 births at naturally con-
ceived group (Supplemental Table 5). Risk of bias and
small-study effects could not be estimated due to limited
studies (n = 2).
Meta-analysis on the overall data showed that ART
children have a higher overall risk of neurodevelopmen-
tal disorders (RR 1.05 [0.97, 1.14], z = 1.29, p = 0.20; I2 =
54%, p = 0.005). Heterogeneity was identified for the
overall studies, and this might be due to cofounder ef-
fects. The overall studies showed no risk of publication
(Egger’s p = 0.501) and no small-study bias
bias
(Habord’s p = 0.962, Peter’s p = 0.991) (Supplemental
Table 4). The absolute risk effect showed no increase in
number of children born with neurodevelopmental dis-
orders with a baseline population risk of 3 per 1000
births (Supplemental Table 5).
ICSI vs conventional IVF (5 studies)
Risk of cerebral palsy
Prevalence of cerebral palsy in children from ICSI and
conventional IVF was reported in 2 studies [22, 26]. ICSI
procedure causes no increase in the prevalence of cere-
bral palsy compared to conventional IVF (RR 0.83 [0.49,

1.42], z = 0.67, p = 0.50; I2 = 0%, p = 0.72) (Fig. 3a), with
an absolute risk 1 fewer children per 1000 birth at ICSI
group, while IVF population risk is 4 per 1000 births
(Supplemental Table 6). The risk of bias statistic and
small-study effects could not be estimated (Supplemen-
tal Table 4).
Risk of intellectual disability
Prevalence of intellectual disability was reported in 3
studies [21, 26, 28]. An increased risk of intellectual dis-
ability was identified in the ICSI group compared to
conventional IVF (RR 1.46 [1.03, 2.08]; z = 2.13, p =
0.03; I2 = 46%, p = 0.16) (Fig. 3b), with absolute risk at
ICSI group is 5 per 1000 births, while in IVF group is 3
per 1000 births (Supplemental Table 6). No risk of pub-
lication bias (Egger’s p = 0.487) and small-study bias
(Habord’s p = 0.786, Peter’s p = 0.311) were detected
(Supplemental Table 4).
Risk of autism spectrum disorder
The number of children diagnosed with ASD was re-
ported in 2 studies [24, 28]. There is an increased risk of
ASD in children born after ICSI procedure compared to
conventional IVF (RR 1.49 [1.05, 2.11], z = 2.23, p =
0.03; I2 = 0%, p = 0.39) (Fig. 3c), with an absolute risk ef-
fect of 1 more children per 1000 births compared to IVF
population risk of 2 per 1000 births (Supplemental Table
6). The risk of bias statistic and small-study effects could
not be calculated (Supplemental Table 4).
The overall evaluation showed higher prevalence of
neurodevelopmental disorders in children from ICSI
compared to children from conventional IVF (RR 1.49
[1.05, 2.11], z = 2.23, p = 0.03; I2 = 0%, p = 0.39).
Frozen vs fresh embryo transfer (6 studies)
Risk of cerebral palsy
Prevalence of cerebral palsy was reported in 3 studies
[22, 26, 27]. Risk of cerebral palsy in children from fro-
zen embryo transfer was similar to fresh embryo transfer
(RR 0.97 [0.55, 1.73], z = 0.09, p = 0.93; I2 = 13%, p =
0.32 (Fig. 4a), with an absolute risk of 64 children in fro-
zen group and 66 children in fresh group per 1000 births
or 2 less children at risk compared to fresh group (Sup-
plemental Table 7). The high number of children at risk

reported prevalence of cerebral palsy in children from ART, it can be concluded that children born from ART have a higher risk of acquiring

was due to one study of case-control with 1:2 ratio of
children with CP and normal children [27]. Risk of pub-
lication bias (Egger’s p = 0.974) and small-study bias
(Habord’s p = 0.601, Peter’s p = 0.186) were undetected
(Supplemental Table 4).
Risk of intellectual disability
Prevalence of intellectual disability was reported in 3 studies
[21, 26, 28]. Risk of intellectual disability in children born
after frozen embryo transfer is not significantly different
compared to children from fresh embryo transfer (RR 0.88
[0.63,1.22]; z = 0.78, p = 0.44; I2 = 0%, p = 0.91) (Fig. 4b),
with absolute risk at 4 per 1000 births in frozen embryo
transfer group and 5 per 1000 births in fresh embryo transfer
group (Supplemental Table 7). Risk of publication bias
(Egger’s p = 0.619) and small-study bias (Habord’s p = 0.937,
Peter’s p = 0.293) were undetected (Supplemental Table 4).
Risk of autism spectrum disorder
Risk of ASD was reported in 2 studies [24, 28]. Risk of
ASD in children born after frozen embryo transfer is
similar to children from fresh embryo transfer (RR 0.81
[0.63, 1.05], z = 1.57, p = 0.12; I2 = 0%, p = 0.76) (Fig. 4c),
with absolute risk at 7 per 1000 births in frozen group
and 8 per 1000 birth in fresh group (Supplemental Table
7). The risk of bias statistic and small-study effects could

from meta-analysis of published data on neurodevelopmental disorders in children from frozen embryo transfer have similar risks with children
born from fresh embryo transfer in acquiring cerebral palsy (a), intellectual disability (b), and autism spectrum disorder (c) at later stages of life
not be estimated due to the limited number of studies
(Supplemental Table 4).
Overall analysis showed that the children from frozen
embryo transfer do not develop higher risk of neurode-
velopmental disorders compared to children from fresh
embryo transfer (RR 0.85 [0.70,1.03]; z = 1.69, p = 0.09;
I2 = 0%, p = 0.87). The risk of neurodevelopmental dis-
order in children from frozen embryos is at 14 per 1000
births while in fresh embryos was 16 per 1000 births
(Supplemental Table 7).
Cofounder effects
Additionally, potential cofounders to the results were also
evaluated. Two cofounders’ effects were confirmed by
meta-analysis, including preterm birth and low birth body
weight. The results showed that the risk of neurodevelop-
mental disorders is higher in children with history of pre-
term birth (RR 2.22 [2.15, 2.30]; z = 48.54, p < 0.0001; I2 =
98%, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 5a), with the absolute risk is 6
more children born with neurodevelopmental disor-
ders in every 1000 births (Supplemental Table 8).

Fig. 5 Forest plots of potential cofounders in children from ART. The results of meta-analyses clearly show that children with history of preterm

intellectual disability, and autistic disorders

Djuwantono et al. Journal of Neurodevelopmental Disorders           (2020) 12:33 
Meanwhile,
the risk of neurodevelopmental disor-
ders in children with history of low birth body weight
(small for gestational age) is also higher compared to
children without any history of low birth body weight
(RR 1.80 [1.70 to 1.91]; z = 19.81, p < 0.0001; I2 =
94%, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 5b), with the absolute risk is 6
more children born with neurodevelopmental disor-
ders in every 1000 births (Supplemental Table 8).
ART procedures have the potentials to cause higher
rates of multiple birth (RR 14.57 [14.42, 14.73], z =
472.11, p < 0.0001; I2 = 100%, p < 0.0001), preterm
birth (RR 3.83 [3.82, 3.93], z = 472.11, p < 0.0001; I2
= 100%, p < 0.0001), and low birth body weight (RR
5.66 [5.50, 5.82], z = 118.10, p < 0.0001; I2 = 100%, p
< 0.0001) compared to non-ART procedure (Supple-
mental Figure 1), with the absolute risk of 386 more
multiple birth, 167 more preterm birth, and 219 more
low birth body weight per 1000 births (Supplemental
Table 9).
Discussion
To our knowledge, a meta-analysis on the neurodevelop-
mental outcomes in children from ART has never been
performed. This study aimed to make consensual con-
clusions from all studies that investigated the neurodeve-
lopmental outcomes in children from ART,
including
ICSI, conventional IVF,
frozen embryo transfer, and
fresh embryo transfer. The results of this study are ex-
pected to provide the reliable information for the pa-
tients and healthcare workers to consider before starting
ART.
As seen in Fig. 2, without taking specific details of the
ART treatments into account, the results show that ART
children develop an increased risk of cerebral palsy, but
not intellectual disability, ASD, or behavioral problems.
Cerebral palsy is a permanent neurological disorder
characterized with disability to coordinate muscle tones
and movements. This condition is caused by the damage
or dysgenesis of brain part(s) that are involved in the co-
ordination and movements of the body. It has been con-
sensually accepted that the common risk factors for
cerebral palsy are preterm birth and low birth body
weight [31, 32]. In our study, we could confirm that
these are the most likely risk factors that were presented
among children from ART with cerebral palsy (Fig. 5,
Supplemental Figure 1). The ART procedures are as-
sociated with higher preterm birth and low birth body
weight, as they are also related to higher rates of
multiple birth. ART procedures could cause monozy-
gotic twinning related to zona pellucida manipulation
and extended in vitro culture. Moreover, double em-
bryo transfers during IVF procedures
resulted in
higher chance of multiple pregnancy [33]. Since the
pathogenesis of cerebral palsy could be initiated with
insults during gestation or after delivery, we could
not conclude if
the pathogenesis of cerebral palsy
among ART children is due to the respiratory distress
that is caused by immature lungs, which eventually
lead to cerebral hypoxia after birth, or as a conse-
quence of dysgenesis of part(s) of the brain that is re-
lated to movements and coordination. Nonetheless,
these findings revealed the importance of optimum
prenatal and neonatal care for ART children.
in children from conventional
Interestingly, when the neurodevelopmental out-
comes in children from ICSI were compared to the
outcomes
in-
creased risks of intellectual disability and ASD were
identified in the ICSI group. It is widely known that
in some cases, intellectual disability and cerebral palsy
are overlapping clinical conditions [34]. However, as
the differences in the prevalence of cerebral palsy in
children from ICSI and conventional IVF are statisti-
cally insignificant, we speculate that in these cases, in-
tellectual disability

factor(s),
such as genetics. Furthermore, ASD has
been associated with numerous genetic disorders, and
has never been indicated as a result of neonatal
in-
sults. Thus, we argue that the cause of higher risks of
intellectual disability and ASD in children from ICSI
is genetic related.
is more
As we know, ICSI is intended to prevent fertilization
failure. One of
the indications that becomes practi-
tioners’ common consideration when suggesting ICSI is
sperm immotility [35]. Despite successes of achieving
pregnancies after ICSI using immotile or morphologic-
ally abnormal spermatozoa [36–39], reports have sug-
gested that the rates of DNA fragmentation in immotile
spermatozoa are higher than in normal spermatozoa
[40]. Furthermore, poor-quality oocytes, advanced ma-
ternal age, and unexplained infertility have also been
used as indications to perform ICSI [41]. Each of the
previously mentioned indication has also been associated
with higher rates of DNA fragmentation; hence, this
might be related to neurodevelopmental disorders. Study
by Porokhovnik et al. correlates infantile autism with el-
evated DNA damage degree [41]; thus, our findings
might be related to any of these factors.
As cryopreservation became more integrated to the
common ART practice nowadays, the comparison be-
tween children from frozen embryo transfer with chil-
dren from fresh embryo transfer was also performed.
As previous reports have suggested, the risk of ac-
quiring DNA fragmentations during cryopreservation
and thawing processes might be associated with re-
duced numbers and proportion of trophectoderm cells
[42], higher prevalence of neurodevelopmental disor-
ders in children from frozen embryo transfer is ex-
pected. To our

showed that there are no significant differences be-
tween the risks of neurodevelopmental disorders in
children from frozen embryo transfer compared to
the risk in children from fresh embryo transfer. Previ-
ous studies also reported that frozen embryo transfer
resulted in increased live birth rate and higher neo-
natal birth body weight [43–45]. The improvement of
cryopreservation techniques, such as vitrification and
elective frozen embryo transfer, might result in better
pregnancy and neonatal outcome [42, 46].
Limitations
The present study has several limitations. First, the num-
ber of studies that reported neurodevelopmental out-
comes from different ART procedures is limited. This
limitation correlates with the limited number of patients
and the possibilities that some of the findings might be
population specific. Secondly, singleton and multiple
births could not be differentiated in some studies. Previ-
ous studies suggested that multiple pregnancy carries
higher risks of prematurity and low birth body weight
[47, 48], both could potentially contribute to the risks of
neurodevelopmental disorders
the
matched case-control studies could introduce potential
conclusion bias on the absolute number of children at
risk in the normal population. To overcome all of these
limitations, future studies that involve larger populations
with sufficient background information are required.
Conclusion
In conclusion, children from ART have a higher risk of
acquiring cerebral palsy than children from natural con-
ceptions. This increased risk is possibly associated with
confounding factors,
including preterm birth and low
body birth weight. Based on this finding, it is reasonable
to perform deliveries of children from ART at facilities
with available neonatal intensive care unit (NICU); thus,
treatment of potential cerebral insults after birth can be
optimized. Furthermore, children from ICSI carry higher
risks of
intellectual disability and ASD than children
from conventional IVF. These findings suggest the im-
portance of
long-term follow-up and preimplantation
genetic screening, particularly in fertilizations by ICSI.
Lastly, cryopreservation and thawing of embryos did not
seem to cause increases in any risks of neurodevelop-
mental disorders; therefore, freeze-all strategy seemed
