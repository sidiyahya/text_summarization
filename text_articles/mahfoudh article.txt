Abstract
Purpose: To test the impact of an enhanced home visiting curriculum on postnatal physical activity in rural, southern, primarily
African American mothers.
Design: Randomized controlled trial.
Setting: Three rural counties in Mississippi.
Participants: Between September 2013 and May 2016, 54 postpartum women randomized to standard home visiting curriculum
(n ¼ 30 control) or lifestyle enhanced home visiting curriculum (n ¼ 24 experimental) were followed for 12 months.
Intervention: The experimental arm of the intervention built upon the Parents as Teachers curriculum (control arm) by adding
culturally tailored, maternal weight management and early childhood obesity prevention components.
Measures: Physical activity behavior and related psychosocial constructs including attitudes, expectations, self-efficacy, social
support, and barriers.
Analysis: Generalized linear mixed models were applied to test for treatment and time effects on physical activity and related
psychosocial constructs.
Results: Postnatal retention rates were 83% and 88% for control and experimental arms, respectively. Mean weekly minutes of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were 28 and 50 minutes at postnatal months 1 and 12 in the control arm and 40 minutes
for both time points in the experimental arm. Although a significant time effect was found, pairwise comparisons failed to reach
statistical significance.
Conclusion: The enhanced treatment was not effective at increasing postnatal physical activity nor improving related psycho-
social construct measures in this cohort of rural, southern women.

Purpose
Performing recommended amounts of daily physical activity is
difficult for all individuals, but perhaps more so for women
who have recently given birth. This is troublesome given the
known benefits of postnatal physical activity for women
including strengthening and toning abdominal muscles, boost-
ing energy, promoting better sleep, relieving stress, improving
fitness, and supporting return to prepregnancy body weight. 1,2
Women who have recently given birth have common barriers
to physical activity (eg, lack of time or access to facilities)
coupled with unique barriers such as added responsibilities
involving the care of their infant which may result in fatigue
from lack of sleep as well as feelings of social isolation
(ie, no one to exercise with). 3 Hence, interventions designed
to positively impact physical activity in women during the

postnatal period must address commonly reported barriers as
well as the unique challenges caring for a new infant entail.
To overcome barriers related to performing regular physical
activity, confidence in one’s ability to make and maintain beha-
vior changes in nonsupportive situations (eg, sedentary beha-
vior settings or opportunities) is required. 4 This confidence or
self-efficacy is a psychosocial construct that has been strongly
linked to performing physical activity. Positive associations
between physical activity and self-efficacy for engaging in
physical activity have been reported in African American
women 5 and women who have recently given birth. 6 Other
psychosocial constructs related to physical activity include
attitudes toward and expectations about physical activity. The
attitude that it is important to be physically active for health, a
belief held by postpartum women, 7 was positively associated
with physical activity participation in African American
women. 8 Likewise, outcome expectations for physical activity
were significantly associated with participation in lifestyle
physical activity in African American women. 9 Thus, perceived
barriers, self-efficacy, attitudes, and expectations should be
considered when designing physical activity interventions tar-
geting African American women in the postnatal period. Social
support from family and friends is another construct positively
associated with physical activity behaviors in African Ameri-
can and postpartum women. 3,9 Consequently, while the study
was not specifically designed to affect social support, it was
measured due to its importance in the target population.
The Delta Healthy Sprouts Project was designed to test the
comparative impact of 2 maternal, infant, and early childhood
home visiting curricula on weight status, dietary intake, phys-
ical activity, and other health behaviors of women and their
infants residing in the rural Lower Mississippi Delta region of
the United States. 10 Results of the gestational period have been
reported elsewhere. 11-13 Descriptions and comparisons of
longitudinal physical activity outcomes of Delta Healthy
Sprouts participants during the postnatal period are presented
in this article. Specifically, longitudinal changes in maternal
physical activity and related psychosocial construct measures
were assessed within and between the control and intervention
arms. Psychosocial constructs included physical activity
related attitudes, expectations, self-efficacy, social support
(family and friends), and barriers. Additionally, associations
among maternal physical activity and related psychosocial
constructs were explored.
Methods
Design
Delta Healthy Sprouts was a randomized 2-arm parallel
controlled trial. It was designed to evaluate the impact of the
Parents as Teachers (PAT, control) curriculum as compared
with a nutrition and physical activity enhanced PAT curriculum
(PATE, experimental) on maternal gestational weight gain,
postpartum weight control, and childhood obesity prevention.
Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms,
465
PAT control or PATE experimental and subsequently followed
for 18 months (6 months gestation through 12 months post-
natal). At the baseline (gestational month 4) visit, informed
written consent was obtained from study participants, demo-
graphic data and anthropometric measures were collected,
24-hour dietary recalls were conducted, and physical activity
as well as other questionnaires were administered. Both arms of
the intervention were delivered in the home to women begin-
ning early in their second trimester of pregnancy by trained
parent educators. Parent educators were African American,
college educated women residing in the target communities.
Home visits occurred monthly and were approximately 60 to
90 minutes in length for the PAT lessons and approximately
90 to 120 minutes for the PATE lessons. The project was
approved by the institutional review board of the Delta State
University (IRB protocol number 12-024) and is registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01746394).
Sample
Recruitment occurred via passive (distribution of flyers and
brochures) and active (study staff on-site) methods at local
health clinics and medical facilities serving pregnant women
and at local health fairs. Women were also referred to the study
by health clinic/department staff, Special Supplemental Nutri-
tion Assistance Program (SNAP) for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) nutritionists, social service agencies, and
enrolled study participants. Inclusion criteria were as follows:
at least 18 years of age; less than 19 weeks pregnant with first,
second, or third child; singleton pregnancy; and resident of
Washington, Bolivar, or Humphreys County in Mississippi.
Recruitment efforts were focused on African American
women. However, race was not an inclusion criterion because
community stakeholders expressed concern about excluding
women of other races who also could benefit from study par-
ticipation. Participant enrollment occurred on a rolling basis;
hence, baseline data were collected from 82 pregnant women
(n ¼ 43 PAT and n ¼ 39 PATE participants) between March
2013 and December 2014.
The target enrollment was 75 women in each of the 2 arms
(control and experimental). The sample size of 150 women was
based on the following assumptions: 20% attrition rate, mean
12-month postnatal weight loss of 1.5 kg in the control arm,
and a 3.8-kg difference between treatment arms for 12-month
postnatal weight loss. 14 Power and sample size calculations
for gestational weight gain within the Institute of Medicine
recommendations and child obesity at 1 year of age also were
performed. 10 However, recruitment was stopped by the study’s
principal investigator prior to reaching these numbers due to
unexpected difficulties recruiting pregnant women meeting
study criteria. Recruitment was extended as long as possible,
but fiscal issues eventually necessitated the closing of this
period. Data collection was completed in May 2016.
Because maternal postnatal physical activity was the primary
focus of this article, analyses were conducted only for the post-
natal cohort (participants who completed the gestational period466

and had at least 1 visit in the postnatal period; n ¼ 54). Five
participants who completed the gestational period but dropped
out of the study prior to the postnatal month (PM) 1 visit were
excluded from the postnatal cohort. Additionally, visits occur-
ring after conception for 1 PAT and 4 PATE participants who
became pregnant again between the PM 2 and PM 10 visits
were excluded from the analyses. Conception dates were
determined by inputting participants’ reported due dates into
an online pregnancy calculator (http://www.calculator.net/preg
nancy-calculator.html.). Figure 1 illustrates the CONSORT
diagram.
Measures
Postnatal physical activity data were collected from partici-
pants at the PM 1, 6, and 12 visits using a modified version
of the Pregnancy and Physical Activity Questionnaire
(PPAQ). 15 Modifications included small wording changes
(eg, driving or riding in a car vs driving or riding in a car or
bus) and time frame adjustment (during this month vs during
this trimester) to make the instrument more relevant to this
population of rural, southern women and the Delta Healthy
Sprouts study design. This 26-item instrument allows for theThomson et al.
calculation of physical activity duration, intensity, specific type
(ie, sedentary, light intensity, moderate intensity, vigorous
intensity, household/caregiving, occupational, and sports/
exercise), and total activity. Test–retest reliability (intraclass
correlation coefficients) ranged from 0.78 for total activity to
0.93 for occupational activity, while correlations between
PPAQ total activity and actigraph cut points ranged from
0.08 to 0.43. 15 The duration of time spent in each activity was
multiplied by its intensity to arrive at a measure of average
weekly energy expenditure attributable to each activity. 15
Moderate and vigorous intensity physical activity responses
were combined into a single category, moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA), because so few women reported
time spent in vigorous activity and minutes of MVPA is a
commonly reported measure of physical activity. Additionally,
participants’ physical activity level was classified as low, mod-
erate, or high using the algorithm given in the 2005 Guidelines
for Data Processing and Analysis of the International Physical
Activity Questionnaire. 16
Psychosocial constructs related to physical activity, includ-
ing attitudes, expectations, self-efficacy, social support (family
and friends), and barriers, 17-20 were measured at the PM 1 and
12 visits. Attitude was composed of 5 survey items that
included a mix of health topics including diet, physical activity,
weight gain, and chronic disease. Because not all items were
specific to physical activity, the item “How important is it for
you to be physically active/exercise daily?” was analyzed
separately. Responses for the attitude items included not at all
important, somewhat important, and very important (1, 2, and 3
points, respectively); higher scores reflected more positive
attitudes. Internal consistency was 0.82 for the total scale. 18
Physical activity expectations (5 items) and barriers (7 items)
were assessed using 6 agreement responses ranging from
strongly disagree (1 point) to strongly agree (6 points). Higher
expectation scores reflected higher expectations about the
benefits of physical activity, while higher barrier scores
reflected more perceived barriers to performing physical activ-
ity. Internal consistency for expectations and barriers ranged
from 0.55 to 0.73. 17 Self-efficacy for physical activity (5 items)
was assessed using 5 confidence statements ranging from not
confident (1 point) to extremely confident (5 points); higher
scores reflected higher self-efficacy. Test–retest and internal
consistency values were 0.68 and 0.83, respectively, while
correlations with reported health habits ranged from 0.32 to
0.40. 20 Social support for physical activity from family and
friends (6 items each) was assessed using 5 frequency
responses ranging from almost never (1 point) to almost always
(5 points); higher scores reflected more social support. Test–
retest values ranged from 0.77 to 0.79, internal consistency
values ranged from 0.84 to 0.91, and correlations with reported
health habits ranged from 0.35 to 0.46. 19 Although these items
were taken from validated instruments, internal consistency of
the 5 scales was assessed in this study as well. Scale scores
were computed by summing the numeric response values for
the individual items composing the scale. Negatively worded
items were reverse coded prior to summing.
467
Anthropometric measures obtained on the participants at
the baseline visit included height, which was measured in
duplicate using a portable stadiometer (model Seca 217; Seca,
Birmingham, United Kingdom), and weight, which was mea-
sured using a digital scale (model SR241; SR Instruments,
Tonawanda, New York). Both measures were performed
without shoes or heavy clothing. Prepregnancy body weight
was self-reported. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
weight (kg) divided by height (m 2 ), where height was aver-
aged if the 2 measurements differed.
Participants provided self-reported information regarding
demographic characteristics (eg, age, marital status, household
size, education, employment, household income, insurance,
prenatal care), SNAP and WIC participation, health history,
current health conditions, breastfeeding intent and duration,
and psychosocial constructs of diet. 19-23 Details regarding other
measures and questionnaire data that were collected, but are not
relevant to the present paper, have been published elsewhere. 10
All measures and questionnaires were collected or adminis-
tered by trained research staff (Parent Educators) using laptop
computers loaded with relevant software (ie, Snap Surveys).
Intervention
The PAT control arm of the intervention followed the nation-
ally recognized, evidence-based, Parents as Teachers ® curri-
culum which included one-on-one home visits, optional
monthly group meetings, developmental screenings, and a
resource network for families. The program seeks to increase
parental knowledge of child development, improve parenting
practices, provide early detection of developmental delays,
prevent child abuse, and increase school readiness. 24 Using
the PAT model, parent educators provided parents with
research-based information and activities during home visits.
Examples of research-based information included ways to
build attachment with their infant, the importance of immuni-
zations, recommended amounts of sleep based on their infant’s
age, and how to introduce solid foods to their infant. Examples
of activities included proper methods for holding and soothing
their infant, teaching their infant to reach for and push objects,
tummy time for their infants, and using small snacks or objects
to build their infant’s fine motor control. Materials were
responsive to parental information requests and were tailored
to the age of the child (or gestational age of the fetus).
The PATE experimental arm of the intervention built upon
the PAT curriculum by adding culturally tailored, maternal
weight management and early childhood obesity prevention
components. Emphasis was placed on educating mothers about
the ways in which they can facilitate the development of appro-
priate eating, physical activity, and other health behaviors in
their children, including modeling these behaviors themselves.
The PATE curriculum was guided by the theoretical underpin-
nings of the social cognitive theory 25 (eg, maternal modeling of
positive health behaviors) and the transtheoretical model of
behavior change 4 (eg, provision of information regarding the
importance of daily physical activity to positively affect468
decisional balance and discussions about overcoming personal
barriers to physical activity to improve self-efficacy). Founda-
tional elements from the Diabetes Prevention Program were
also incorporated and included a flexible, culturally sensitive,
individualized educational curriculum taught on a one-to-one
basis. 26 Flexibility was characterized by the ability of partici-
pants to request and receive specific nutrition and physical
activity information of interest to them. The use of recruitment
flyers, monthly newsletters, and instructional digital video
disks that contained pictures of African American women and
infants and the provision of cookbooks containing regional/
local recipes that were modified to include healthier prepara-
tions or ingredient substitutions embodied cultural sensitivity.
The use of US Department of Agriculture MyPlate daily eating
plans for gestational or postnatal periods, weight gain and loss
charts, and personal goal setting for diet and physical activity
represented the individualized aspect of the curriculum.
Finally, anticipatory guidance and parenting support principles,
elements from the Infant Feeding Activity and Nutrition
Trial, 27 were integrated into the experimental curriculum.
Anticipatory guidance involves providing practical, develop-
mentally appropriate, child health information to parents in
anticipation of significant physical, emotional, and psycholo-
gical milestones. 28 Parenting support emphasizes children’s
psychological and behavioral goals, logical and natural conse-
quences, mutual respect, and encouragement techniques. 29
The PATE intervention components included appropriate
weight gain during pregnancy and weight management after
pregnancy, nutrition and physical activity in the gestational
(mother) and postnatal (mother and infant) periods, breast-
feeding, appropriate introduction of solid foods, and parental
modeling of positive health behaviors. Postnatal maternal
physical activity was one of the topics of the PM 6, 9, and
11 visits. Additionally, participants set exercise goals at each
of the postnatal visits. Parent educators were trained to dis-
cuss barriers to performing physical activity as well as ways to
overcome these barriers. Further details regarding parent edu-
cator training, lesson plan outlines, schedules, and study
methodology have been published elsewhere. 10
Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software, ver-
sion 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). Descriptive
statistics, including means, standard deviations, frequencies,
and percentages, were used to summarize participants’ socio-
demographic characteristics and anthropometric measures.
Chi-square tests of association or Fisher exact tests (categorical
measures) and 2-sample t tests (continuous measures) were
used to assess differences between PAT and PATE partici-
pants’ baseline, gestational, and some postnatal characteristics
and measures.
Reliability (consistency) of the psychosocial construct scales
of physical activity was computed using Cronbach coefficient a.
Reliability was assessed because the scales represented modified
versions of the original validated instruments. A Cronbach a
American Journal of Health Promotion 32(2)
value of 0.7 or above was considered acceptable reliability. 30
Associations between physical activity and psychosocial con-
structs of physical activity measured at the PM 1 and 12 visits
were computed using Pearson correlation coefficients.
Generalized linear mixed models, using maximum likeli-
hood estimation, were used to test for significant treatment,
time, and treatment  time (interaction) effects on postnatal
physical activity outcomes. Maximum likelihood estimation is
an approach for handling missing data in repeated measures.
Distributions of the postnatal psychosocial construct and
MVPA variables were checked for approximate normality
based on both goodness-of-fit tests (Cramer-von Mises and
Anderson-Darling) and visual inspection. All distributions
either passed the goodness-of-fit tests or failed the tests but
appeared sufficiently normal for the underlying assumptions
of normality to be reasonable for practical purposes of analysis.
Hence, postnatal psychosocial constructs and MVPA were
modeled using a Gaussian (normal) distribution with an iden-
tity link function for which expected values of outcome vari-
ables are linear functions of the explanatory variables.
Treatment (PAT vs PATE) was modeled as a fixed effect for
all outcomes. Time (PM 1, 6, and 12 visits) was modeled as a
repeated measure using a variance covariance structure. Least
squares means with 95% confidence limits were computed
using these models. Importance of daily physical activity was
modeled using a binomial distribution with a logit link function
and time was modeled as a repeated measure using an inde-
pendent correlation matrix. Least squares means (log odds)
with 95% confidence limits were computed using these models.
The first set of models included treatment, time, and treatment
 time as fixed (explanatory) effects. A second MVPA model
included the importance of daily physical activity and postnatal
BMI (continuous form) both at PM 1 as additional explanatory
variables. The significance level of the tests was set at 0.05.
Results
Postnatal period retention rates for the PAT and PATE treat-
ment arms were 83% (25/30) and 88% (21/24) and did not
differ significantly between treatment arms (P ¼ .668). Mean
number of postnatal visits was 10.2 and 9.9 (P ¼ .717) for PAT
and PATE participants, respectively. Table 1 presents compar-
isons between treatment arms for baseline sociodemographic
and anthropometric characteristics of the postnatal cohort. Sig-
nificant differences between PAT and PATE participant char-
acteristics at baseline were not found, with the exception of
percentages receiving SNAP benefits (ie, food and nutrition
assistance for low-income individuals and families). Signifi-
cantly more PAT participants (87%) received SNAP benefits
as compared to PATE participants (63%). The majority of both
PAT and PATE participants were African American (97% and
96%), single (87% and 92%), receiving WIC (93% and 83%),
and young (mean age ¼ 24 and 23 years). Additionally, mean
postpregnancy BMI was in the obese category for both PAT
(30 kg/m 2 ) and PATE (32 kg/m 2 ) participants.Thomson et al.

Table 2 presents postnatal physical activity (weekly minutes
of MVPA) results. Physical activity was analyzed in continu-
ous form because so few participants were classified as per-
forming a moderate level of physical activity (5 or less
participants at each of the 3 time points) and no participants
performed at the high level. Mean MVPA for PAT participants
was 28, 50, and 50 minutes per week at PM 1, 6, and 12,
respectively. Mean MVPA for PATE participants was 40, 42,
and 40 minutes per week at PM 1, 6, and 12, respectively.
Although a significant time effect was found, pairwise tests
failed to reach statistical significance. Similarly, neither the
importance of daily physical activity nor postnatal BMI at
PM 1 was significant explanatory variables for postnatal
MVPA in the second model analyzed.
Reliability was sufficient for physical activity expectations,
self-efficacy, social support for family, social support for friends,

and barriers scales at PM 1 (Cronbach a ¼ 0.90, 0.96, 0.86, 0.86,
and 0.86, respectively). Likewise, reliability was sufficient for
the attitude scale encompassing diet, physical activity, and
chronic disease at PM 1 (Cronbach a ¼ 0.82).
Results of the correlation analysis for MVPA and psycho-
social constructs for physical activity revealed few significant
results. Weekly minutes of MVPA at PM 1 were significantly
correlated with expectations (r ¼ 0.29, P ¼ .036) and friend
support (r ¼ 0.28, P ¼ .040) at PM 1. No other associations
between MVPA at PM 1, 6, or 12, and psychosocial constructs
for physical activity were significant.
Table 3 presents longitudinal comparisons between treat-
ment arms for the psychosocial constructs related to physical
activity. Social support for physical activity from friends was
significantly higher across time in the PATE as compared to
the PAT arm. Additionally, at both time points, PAT partici-
pants were as likely to indicate that daily physical activity is
very important versus not at all or somewhat important. How-
ever, PATE participants were over twice as likely to indicate
that daily physical activity is very important versus not at all
or somewhat important at PM 1, while they were equally as
likely to indicate either response at PM 12. There were no
other significant differences or changes in the psychosocial
constructs.
Discussion
In this article, descriptions and comparisons of postnatal mater-
nal physical activity behaviors as well as related psychosocial
constructs for rural, southern, primarily African American
women who participated in the Delta Healthy Sprouts Project
are presented. Results indicate that the enhanced PATE curri-
culum was not effective at increasing physical activity for this
cohort of primarily sedentary women during the 12 months
following the birth of their infant. Further, the enhanced PATE470

curriculum did not result in positive changes in physical activ-
ity related to attitudes, expectations, self-efficacy, social sup-
port from family and from friends, or barriers at the end of 12
months. The lack of intervention effect observed in this study is
troublesome given that these women were generally perform-
ing less than one-third of the recommended 150 minutes of
weekly MVPA. Clearly, the sedentary behavior of this popu-
lation of rural, southern, low-income, primarily African Amer-
ican women is a significant public health concern.
Possible explanations for the lack of intervention effect may
be found in the psychosocial constructs related to physical
activity. Physical activity expectations have been positively
correlated with performed physical activity in African Amer-
ican women. 9 However, PATE participants’ physical activity
expectations and attitudes toward healthy behaviors, including
the single item addressing daily physical activity, were high in
the early postnatal period leaving little room for improvement.
However, the decrease in likelihood that PATE participants
believed daily physical activity to be very important at PM
12 as compared to PM 1 was surprising and concerning given
the PATE curriculum’s emphasis on performing recommended
amount of physical activity. It is possible that this negative
change was the result of the PATE participants’ reactance to
the intervention. 31 That is, PATE participants may have felt
pressured by the Parent Educators (eg, setting monthly physical
activity goals or discussing why goals were not met) to accept
the importance of daily physical activity which resulted in its
unintended devaluing. If this adverse reaction occurred, it may
help explain why weekly minutes of MVPA did not change in
the postnatal period for PATE participants.
Supporting the reactance to the intervention explanation is
the significant time effect found for weekly minutes of MVPA
that was arguably driven by the PAT participants. The PAT
curriculum did not include any physical activity intervention
other than child-related materials and activities (eg, sugges-
tions for active play with young children). Thus, the increase
in physical activity observed in the PAT arm likely represents
the change one would expect to occur as women recover from
the stress of birth and fatigue associated with the care of an
infant. Conversely, the added information and discussions
about the importance of daily physical activity that were part
of the PATE curriculum may have caused reactance to this
behavior resulting in the lack of any apparent increase in activ-
ity for the PATE arm.
Another possible explanation for the lack of intervention
effect may be related to self-efficacy. Higher levels of self-
efficacy for physical activity as well as self-efficacy for over-
coming perceived barriers to physical activity have been asso-
ciated with higher levels of physical activity in postnatal
women. 6 The low levels of self-efficacy apparent in PATE
participants throughout the postnatal period coupled with the
lack of reduction in perceived barriers suggest that the inter-
vention was not effective at empowering these women to make
positive changes in their physical activity. A look at the per-
centages of PATE participants setting and meeting their phys-
ical activity goals lends support to this hypothesis. All but 1
PATE participant consistently set physical activity goals
(defined as setting goals for more than 70% of the visits).
However, only 30% of participants met their goals more than
50% of the time, implying that while these participants were
willing to set goals, they were unable to achieve them the
majority of the time.
Despite the lack of intervention effect found in the current
study, other researchers have been successful in their efforts to
increase the amount of physical activity performed by postnatal
women. However, we would argue that the target population
for the current study presented challenges that were not all
present in participants of the successful interventions, includ-
ing relatively young age, predominantly African American and
of low socioeconomic status, majority obese, single parent
household, sedentary, and rural county residency. In a tailored
telephone counseling plus web site intervention study, partici-
pants were older (mean age of 32 years), married (>77%), more
highly educated, primarily Asian or Pacific Islander, and had aThomson et al.
mean BMI in the overweight category. 32 In a telephone-based
pilot study, participants were older (mean age of 31 years),
predominantly white (94%), and performed higher amounts
of exercise at baseline (69 minutes/week as compared to <40
minutes/week in our study). 33 Further, the contact frequency
for the pilot study was higher (weekly) than in our study
(biweekly). Hence, researchers planning to conduct home vis-
iting interventions should consider increasing the frequency of
home visits or adding telephone contacts between home visits.
The longitudinal design of this study is one of its greatest
strengths because women were followed for 1 year after the
birth of their infant. Additionally, the population studied is a
strength because rural, southern, African American, and post-
partum female populations are at high risk of physical inactiv-
ity. 32,34-36 Nonetheless, data collection was not blinded and
therefore a potential source of bias. However, it was not prac-
tically, logistically, or financially feasible to have a second set
of blinded research staff whose purpose was solely to collect
data. Moreover, it is unlikely that bias occurred on the part of
the parent educator or the participant (eg, provision of socially
desirable responses), given the lack of effect observed in this
study. Additionally, the study would have benefited from the
use of an objective measure of physical activity, such as a
SO WHAT? Implications for
Health Promotion Practitioners
and Researchers
What is already known on this topic?
Women who have recently given birth are at high risk of
physical inactivity due to the added responsibilities and
associated fatigue caring for a new infant entails. Few
physical activity interventions targeting postpartum
women have been conducted in rural, southern, African
American populations.
What does this article add?
This article suggests that the provision of information
about the importance of physical activity, discussions
about overcoming barriers to physical activity, and set-
ting monthly physical activity goals are insufficient to
empower postpartum women to increase their physical
activity level. Further, it reinforces the need for physical
activity interventions targeting rural, southern, African
American women in the early postnatal period.
What are the implications for health promotion
practice or research?
Determining intervention components that positively
impact intended health behaviors and components with
no impact on intended health behaviors is important for
informing future research.

pedometer or an accelerometer. Finally, arguably the most
concerning limitation of this study is the small sample size
which may have limited the ability to detect statistically sig-
nificant changes in the PATE arm as well as differences
between the 2 treatment arms.
In conclusion, interventions designed to address the predo-
minantly sedentary behavior of rural, southern, African Amer-
ican women in the early postnatal period are sorely needed as
these women are at high risk of physical inactivity. Suggestions
for future research interventions targeting this population of
women include the formation of participant walking groups
initially led by parent educators, provision of physical activity
tracking devices that also may serve as objective measures of
physical activity, and provision of incentives such as coupons
or discounts on membership fees for local fitness clubs and
associated child care. Additionally, the examination of town
or neighborhood environmental characteristics such as the
location and condition of parks and neighborhood walkability
will likely provide useful information that can be incorporated
in the design of future physical activity interventions in these
communities.
